Dataset and model checkpoints can be download at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oc7CVpJPo1M6x1JHVZaHaYaeMNk6tbwQ?usp=share_link). Our dataset, CTSDT, consists of 35,108 conversations and 1,707,564 tweets regarding the topic of COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. This is the first dataset for the studies of contextual target-specific stance detection on Twitter. We are also providing pre-trained models for ConMulAttn on CTSDT and other popular datasets.
