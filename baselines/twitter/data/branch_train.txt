hello  is  this  thing  on!!!    cant  believe  im  three  months  late  to  the  party,  but  just  noticed  that  the  pertussis  (whooping  cough)  vaccination  guidelines  have  been  updated  in  a  way  that  i  think  is  very  positive  and  exciting!!  (thread)#medtwitter  #epitwitter[SEP]previously,  you  got  the  a  series  of  vaccines  as  a  kid,  one  tdap  booster  at  age  -,  and  then  just  the  td  (minus  p  for  pertussis)  every    years  after.  reasons:  seemed  like  tdap  might  have  more  side  effects  +  not  much  added  public  health  benefit  to  vaccinating  adults[SEP]in  light  of  clinical  evidence  theres  no  increased  risk  of  adverse  events  from  tdap  vs  td,  providers  can  now  choose  tdap  or  td  every    years.  **i  am  not  a  doctor**,  but  based  on  personal  experience  v  much  encourage  folks  to  ask  their  drs  for  the  tdap!![SEP]heres  why:  theres  evidence  that  pertussis  immunity  can  wane  within  -  years.  so,  since  my  docs  followed  the  previous  guidelines  &amp;  gave  me  tdap  in    &amp;  the  td  in  ,  i  may  have  had  *no*  immunity  remaining  last  fall,  when  i  developed  this  cough[SEP]quirky  as  i  am,  im  not  the  only  person  this  has  happened  to.  after  decades  of  keeping  cases  low  following  the  vaccines  introduction,  weve  seen  a  resurgence  in  recent  years.  new  cases  are  still  low,  but  this  could  happen  to  you  too.[SEP]one  new  phrase  i  started  using  a  lot  in  october  -  posttussive  emesis  is  when  you  cough  so  hard  you  throw  up.  this  used  to  be  called  the  day  cough.  i  had  a  rough  st  quarter  of  grad  school,  but  im  fine  now.  the  reason  all  this  matters  is  because  this  disease  can  kill  babies.[SEP]another  important  point  about  the  vaccine  guidelines  -  its  recommended  that  pregnant  people  get  vaccinated.  they  can  pass  on  the  antibodies,  which  helps  keep  infants  protected  before  they  get  vaccinated.[SEP]even  though  i  still  got  sick,  the  vaccines  super  effective.  while  i  was  asymptomatic  &amp;  highly  contagious,  i  had  contact  with  multiple  newborns/parents/caregivers.  none  of  them  got  sick.  so  the  vaccine  did  its  job  -  it  kept  the  babies  safe.  herd  immunity,  yall!!  #vaccineswork	0

in  conclusion,  just  vaccinate  your  god  damn  kids.  dont  read  things  off  the  internet  and  make  decisions  that  can  possibly,  jeopardize  your  childrens  lives.  vaccinations  are  made  compulsory  for  a  reason.[SEP]they  are  to  ensure  that  your  childrens  immune  system  are  able  to  fight  against,  life-threatening  diseases.  by  vaccinating  them,  their  immune  system  are  able  to  produce  antibodies,  against  the  weakened  form  of  the  virus.[SEP]hence,  in  the  event  your  children  do  get  infected,  which  i  hope  not,  they  already  have  antibodies  to  fight  the  infection.  for  your  information,  viruses  are  harder  to  treat,  because  it  is  very  much  dependent  on  your  bodys  ability  to  produce  antibodies  and  fight  against  them.[SEP]this  is  unlike  bacterial  infections,  where  antibiotics  are  able  to  kill  the  bacteria.  so,  just  please  please,  vaccinate  your  children.  itll  really  help  them.  #vaccineswork	0

when  i  was  a  kid,  i  learned  about  polio  and  how  it  was  defeated  by  a  vaccine.  i  saw  pictures  of  children  lining  up  for  vaccination,  and  i  wondered  what  it  would  be  like  to  live  at  such  a  pivotal  moment.  /[SEP]i  wondered  what  it  would  be  like  to  be  a  parent  who  no  longer  needed  to  worry  about  their  child  waking  up  paralyzed;  what  it  would  be  like  to  be  a  child  who  could  go  out  to  play  with  friends  without  fear.  /[SEP]we  are  all  living  in  just  such  a  pivotal  moment,  and  we  all  have  a  role  to  play    just  like  our  parents  and  grandparents  did.  we  can  defeat  this  virus  by  getting  vaccinated  when  we  are  able,  and  we  can  protect  each  other  by  wearing  masks  and  distancing  until  then.  /[SEP]if  we  work  together,  next  year  we  will  be  able  to  spend  time  with  friends,  send  our  children  off  to  school,  and  hug  our  elderly  parents  without  fear  that  we  might  give  them  a  virus  and  inadvertently  kill  them.  this  future  will  be  here  before  we  know  it.  /[SEP]if  youve  read  this  far,  please  also  consider  making  a  donation  to  eliminate  polio  from  the  world  forever.  we  started  vaccination  in  ,  but  the  job  isnt  finished.  children  in  afghanistan  and  pakistan  still  wake  up  paralyzed.  /[SEP]we  are  incredibly  close  to  elimination.  polio  cases  have  already  decreased  by  over  %.  #vaccineswork  /	0

if  @nygovcuomo  had  widened  eligibility  first,  as  in:  that  this  happened  on  january  th,  .(/n)[SEP]then  ny  hospitals  would  have  acted  differently  to  his  prior  order  of  "use  it  or  lose  it,  and  get  fined",  issued  on  january  ,  .  at  this  time,  hospitals  were  not  allowed  to  vaccinate  patients,  even  though  many  were  clamoring  to  do  so.  (/n)[SEP]as  a  consequence,  it  is  not  surprising  (and  entirely  predictable  based  on  the  incentive  created  by  @nygovcuomo)  that  many  academic  medical  centers  vaccinated  lower-risk  and  non-patient  facing  staff,  as  outlined  today  in  the  @nytimes  by  @apoorva_nyc  (/n)[SEP]it  is  important  to  get  at  the  bottom  of  why  this  occurred  and  to  report  this  critical  problem  with  a  more  substantial  journalistic  approach.  i  am  deeply  frustrated  with  the  #vaccinestrategy  and  utter  failure  at  the  executive  level  to  put  processes  in  place  for  a  more  (/n)[SEP]equitable  approach.  the  article  has  many  legitimate  points  -  employees  of  academic  medical  centers  that  do  not  engage  in  patient-facing  activities  should  not  have  received  the  vaccine.  my  comments  also  do  not  apply  to  medical  centers  outside  of  new  york  state  highlighted  (/n)[SEP]in  the  article.  in  hindsight,  @nygovcuomo  should  have  expanded  #sars_cov_  vaccine  eligibility  before  threatening  medical  centers  with  fines  for  holding  on  the  vaccine  stocks.  we  need  a  public  system  in  place  now  to  distribute  #covid  vaccine  in  the  community  (/n)[SEP]and  need  to  focus  on  high-risk  populations  and  lower  barriers  to  #vaccine  access.  this  was  evident  months  ago  and  reflects  inadequate  planning  at  the  statewide  level.  if  we  institute  purity  tests  for  vaccine  eligibility,  rollout  will  be  slow,  painful  and  result  in  further  (/n)[SEP]loss  of  life.  academic  medical  centers  simply  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  act  as  the  major  vaccination  sites  for  high-risk  individuals.  i  am  proud  of  the  many  colleagues  @sloan_kettering  who  have  volunteered  to  help  with  vaccinations.  in  the  end,  i  share  the  goal  of  getting  (/n)[SEP]the  vaccine  into  arms  as  equitably  and  rapidly  as  possible.  we  are  doing  our  level  best  in  these  extraordinary  times,  and  working  beyond  capacity  to  diagnose,  treat,  heal,  and  vaccinate  patients.  #idtwitter  #vaccineswork  @nytimes  @apoorva_nyc	0
