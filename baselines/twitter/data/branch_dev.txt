ive  seen  a  lot  of  covid  in  the  er  recently.with  so  many  people  getting  infected  recently,  some  folks  may  wonder  whats  the  point  of  getting  vaccinated  at  all?and  is  there  really  any  value  to  a  booster  dose  if  ive  had  two  pfizer/moderna  or  a  shot  of  j&amp;j?my  observations:[SEP]every  patient  ive  seen  with  covid  thats  had  a  rd  ‘booster  dose  has  had  mild  symptoms.by  mild  i  mean  mostly  sore  throat.  lots  of  sore  throat.  also  some  fatigue,  maybe  some  muscle  pain.no  difficulty  breathing.  no  shortness  of  breath.  all  a  little  uncomfortable,  but  fine.[SEP]most  patients  ive  seen  that  had    doses  of  pfizer/moderna  still  had  ‘mild  symptoms,  but  more  than  those  who  had  received  a  third  dose.more  fatigued.  more  fever.  more  coughing.  a  little  more  miserable  overall.but  no  shortness  of  breath.  no  difficulty  breathing.mostly  fine.[SEP]most  patients  ive  seen  that  had  one  dose  of  j&amp;j  and  had  covid  were  worse  overall.  felt  horrible.  fever  for  a  few  days  (or  more).  weak,  tired.  some  shortness  of  breath  and  cough.but  not  one  needing  hospitalization.  not  one  needing  oxygen.not  great.  but  not  life-threatening.[SEP]and  almost  every  single  patient  that  ive  taken  care  of  that  needed  to  be  admitted  for  covid  has  been  unvaccinated.every  one  with  profound  shortness  of  breath.  every  one  whose  oxygen  dropped  when  they  walked.  every  one  needing  oxygen  to  breath  regularly.[SEP]the  point  is  youre  gonna  hear  about  a  lot  of  people  getting  covid  in  the  coming  days  and  weeks.those  that  have  been  vaccinated  and  got  a  booster  dose  will  mostly  fare  well  with  minimal  symptoms.those  getting  two  doses  might  have  a  few  more  symptoms,  but  should  still  do  well.[SEP]those  who  got  a  single  j&amp;j  similarly  may  have  more  symptoms,  but  have  more  protection  than  the  unvaccinated  (if  you  got  a  single  dose  of  j&amp;j,  please  get  another  vaccine  dosepreferably  pfizer  or  modernaasap!)but  as  ive  witnessed  in  the  er,  the  greatest  burden  still  falls  on…[SEP]the  unvaccinated.  those  who  havent  gotten  a  single  dose  of  vaccine.theyre  the  most  likely  to  need  oxygen.  theyre  the  most  likely  to  have  complications.  theyre  the  most  likely  to  get  admitted.  and  the  most  likely  to  stay  in  the  hospital  for  days  or  longer  with  severe  covid.[SEP]these  are  all  just  observations  from  my  recent  shifts  in  the  er.  but  the  same  has  been  borne  out  by  local  and  national  data  showing  that  the  unvaccinated  make  up  a  very  disproportionate  share  of  those  with  severe  disease,  needing  hospitalization,  and  dying  from  covid.[SEP]so  no  matter  your  political  affiliation,  or  thoughts  on  masks,  or  where  you  live  in  this  country,  as  an  er  doctor  youd  trust  with  your  life  if  you  rolled  into  my  emergency  room  at  am,  i  promise  you  that  youd  rather  face  the  oncoming  omicron  wave  vaccinated.please  be  safe.[SEP]@craig_a_spencer  thank  you  dr.  for  your  observations  and  assuring  the  public  the  science  is  the  science.  #getvaccinatednow	0
