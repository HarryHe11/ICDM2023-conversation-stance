to  those  worried  about  #bellspalsy:.  it  is  just  as  common  in  the  normal  population.  the  vaccine  is  not  causing  additional  cases..  a  couple  of  years  ago,  my  cousin  got  it  -  because  of  a  mild  ear  infection.  recovered  in  a  week  with  absolutely  no  issues.#vaccineswork	0
.  all  drug/vaccine  trials  have  such  cases.  it  is  absolutely  normal  and  expected.  it  doesnt  mean  that  you  too  will  experience  such  side  effects.  these  effects  occur  in  "susceptible  people"  -  those  with  a  history  of  similar  diseases/allergies/immune  reactions.#vaccineswork	0

blindingly  obvious  that  travel  and  hospitality  industries  will  want  #vaccinated  patrons  e.g.  ryan  airs  jab  and  go.  nobody  in  their  right  minds  would  want  to  run  a  company  responsible  for  a  new  outbreak  of  #covid  -  the  publicity  alone  would  close  the  business  down  forever.	0

tell  people  the  truth.the  moderna  and  pfizer  vaccines  are  among  the  best  vaccines  ever  created,  with  effectiveness  rates  of  about    percent  after  two  doses.  thats  on  par  with  the  vaccines  for  chickenpox  and  measles.  #crushcovid  #vaccineswork	0

globally,  the  history  of  #vaccinehesitancy  can  be  traced  back  to  the  th  century  resistance  to  #smallpox  vaccines.prof  @tuntoyins  researched  such  resistance  in  th  century  abeokuta  where  africans  were  involved  in  the  processes  and  decisions  shaping  their  medical  futures.	1
studies  showed  that  #vaccinehesitancy  can  be  as  a  result  of  rumours,  fake  news,  conspiracy  theories,  fears,  and  panic  attached  to  vaccination.these  could  be  premised  on  cultural,  religious  and  racial  belief.	1
