@mcpli  @evan  congratulations,  to  be  anything  good  in  texas  is  not  easy  and  very  commendable.	0
@mcpli  great  job  yall	0
@mcpli  considering  how  many  unvaccinated  are  pouring  over  the  border  in  the  rgv,  thats  probably  a  good  idea.	0
@mcpli  given  whats  been  happening  at  the  border,  this  is  hardly  surprising.  rgv  residents  are  among  those  at  greatest  risk.	0
@mcpli  hooray  for  rgv.houston,  home  of  one  of  the  largest  medical  centers  in  the  world,  is  far  behind  that!crazy  to  me  that  anyone  would  risk  covid  over  a  shot  to  prevent  it.#getvaccinated	0
@mcpli  this  is  refreshing  news.  the  rgv  suffered  last  summer  as  a  significant  hotspot.  im  so  relieved  for  them.	0

@gavinnewsom  @latimes  while  its  good  to  see  us  doing  so  much  better  than  the  crazy  states,  our  numbers  are  sadly  going  up.  need  to  get  more  people  vaccinated.  and  mask  up.	0
@gavinnewsom  @latimes  this  is  how  every  wave  has  started.  it  hits  florida  first.  then  you  gloat  how  california  is  much  better  because  youre  so  smart.  then  california  gets  hit  as  hard  as  florida  was  and  florida  drops  back  down.[SEP]@realaaronbergh  @gavinnewsom  @latimes  if  californias  vaccination  rate  continues  to  rise  and  be  higher  than  fl,  i  dont  see  that  happening.  unless  the  unvaccinated  created  a  whole  new  strain  that  dramatically  decreases  vaccine  efficacy.	0

@erictopol  @raehanbobby  doesnt  a  lot  of  this  have  to  do  with  the  time  between  vaccine  dosages?  the  us  and  isreal  are  running  into  problems  with  the  three  weeks  between  shots  whereas  the  uk  and  canada  did    weeks  between  shots.  more  vaccinated  individuals  spreading  covid  in  the  states	0
@erictopol  this  doesnt  seem  explainable  by  the  different  vaccination  rates  only.  id  say  obesity  is  probably  the  bigger  causal  factor.	0
@erictopol  it  would  be  fascinating  to  see  an  overlay  of  compliance  with  basic  public  health  measures  such  as  masking  in  indoor  settings,  especially  as  it  pertains  to  curtailing  the  spread  in  the  yet  unvaccinated.[SEP]@stevenjfrisch  @erictopol  and  are  schools  open  too?  unvaccinated  &lt;yo  will  be  an  issue  and  schools  open  in  the  southern  us  but  not  much  of  the  northern  us  -  not  sure  about  canada	0
@rwill  @erictopol  more  likely  the  higher  percentage  of  people  vaccinated.[SEP]@markfrancisjack  @erictopol  obviously  a  major  factor,  but  its  not  univariate  correlation.  there  are  differences  in  seasonality.  high  temperature  states  such  as  fl  and  la  are  leading  the  way  in  us.  hawaii  also  rising.	0
@erictopol  i  do  not  think  is  just  vaccination.  some  states  have  relaxed  social  distancing  and  masking  rules,  and  that  is  also  a  big  part  of  the  problem  in  the  us.	0
@rwill  @erictopol  more  likely  the  higher  percentage  of  people  vaccinated.[SEP]@markfrancisjack  @rwill  @erictopol  i  think  it  could  also  be  that  canada  was  hit  with  delta  sooner.  ontario  had  a  delta  wave  in  early  spring  and  is  pretty  much  all  delta  at  this  point.	0

@erictopol  i  mean  canada  also  has  a  population  thats  the  same  as  california  in  a  country  thats  actually  slightly  bigger  than  the  us.....its  literally  like  if  you  took  californias  population  and  spread  it  across  the  us  with  no  other  people.  im  sure  that  helps.[SEP]@bbqbaseball  @erictopol  absolutely.  population  density  has  a  ton  to  do  with  it.[SEP]@pemdocresists  @bbqbaseball  @erictopol  canada  has  the  same  population  density  as  the  us.  we  arent  spread  across  the  tundra.  the  vast  majority  of  us  live  within  a  .  hour  drive  to  the  us  border.remote  indigenous  communities  were  most  at  risk  and  vaccinated  first.	0
@rwill  @erictopol  at  this  point  in  time,  climate  is  pretty  similar  in  both  countries  who  are  in  summer  so  i  dont  see  your  point.    key  differences  now  is  more  double-vaccinated  people  in  canada,  as  well  as  mask  wearing  mandates  still  in  effect  in  indoor  public  spaces  (stores,  public  transit,  etc)	0
@erictopol  published  in  the  new  england  journal  of  medicine  today.  peer-reviewed.  large  sample  size.  sound  methodology.  real-world  data.  pfizers  and  astrazenecas  vaccines  are  highly  effective  against  the  delta  (b...)  variant.	0
@erictopol  for  ontario  at  least  i  also  think  the  fact  we  never  stopped  masking  up  indoors  and  masking  compliance  is  high  probably  really  helps  too.	0

@oregongovbrown  thanks  for  lying  to  us.  “get  vaccinated  and  you  can  get  back  to  normal  life”.  i  knew  from  the  start  that  yall  would  go  back  on  this  deal.  i  dont  blame  the  unvaxxed.  i  blame  incompetent  and  dishonest  public  policy  makers.[SEP]@renwa  @oregongovbrown  that  was  a  path,  but  not  everyone  did  the  jab  in  our  state.  so...the  virus  was  able  to  mutate  into  delta.of  course,  we  also  forget  that  this  is  a  global  issue,  so  ...you  have  to  get  everyone  all  over  the  world.[SEP]@velvetackbar  @oregongovbrown  look,  israel  and  uk  have  very  high  vaccination  rates.  oregon  has  on  one  of  the  highest  in  the  us  and  yet  each  of  these  areas  are  having  problems.  perhaps  its  not  an  issue  of  everybody  doing  their  “jab”.	1

@oregongovbrown  forcing  the  vaccine  on  nurses  and  doctors  will  cause  a  health  care  shortage.  when  you  cant  get  treated  at  the  hospital  and  are  turned  away,  just  remember  you  didnt  want  an  unvaccinated  nurse  or  doctor  helping  you.  if  you  die  waiting,  you  advocated  for  this.	1

@jerryhelton  @mrsftbl  @notmyworkacount  @foxnews  bullshit!  our  body  and  immunity  is  designed  to  deal  with  the  virus.  what  people  have  to  change  is  the  diet.  you  are  all  pro  vaccine,  but  probably  a  fat  azz.  be  healthy  and  your  body  will  be  fine	1
@thepoliticview  @alicatt_  @foxnews  %  is  better  than  a  semi  annul  booster  shot  on  top  of  a  "flu"  shot  that  doesnt  work  either.  if  its  a  vaccine,  you  should  only  need  it  once.  i  have  never  in  my  life  taken  the  flu  shots  that  were  available  (allergic  to  ingredients),  i  got  the  flu,  fought  it  and  recovered.[SEP]@diane_zanutto  @alicatt_  @foxnews  cool  story!  lots  of  people  dont  survive  the  flu,  and  you  put  them  at  risk  by  walking  around  infected  though,  and  the  flu  doesnt  even  kill  ,  people  in    months.  so  ill  get  a  vaccine  because  im  not  a  big  baby.	0

@foxnews  i  agree  %  only  the  right  to  life  is  sacrosanct  during  a  pandemic.  all  other  rights  take  second  fiddle.  if  it  means  forcing  people  to  save  lives  is  the  only  option  left,  so  be  it.  we  welcome  #vaccinepassports.  im  #vaccinated  and  alive  and  kicking.	0
