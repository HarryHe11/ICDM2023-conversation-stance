I  think  it  could  but  it  would  meen  everyone  being  stoned  at  the  same  time  which  is  illogical  because  we'd  need  some  straight  people  to  make  snacks  for  the  rest  of  us	0
Cannabis  is  a  wonderful  substance,  it  is  harmless,  a  great  way  to  relax  and  has  never  killed  anyone...  But  saying  that  a  drug  can  bring  world  peace,  thats  pushing  it  to  far.	0
People  with  latent  schitzotypal  tendencies  often  respond  to  marijuana  with  severe  panic  attacks  and  hallucinations,  curled  into  the  fetal  position  on  the  floor,  clutching  their  heads  and  screaming  for  help  and  about  how  much  their  souls  hurts.	1
All  that  Marijuana  is  doing  is  making  people  less  intelligent,  less  concerned  about  life,  less  concerned  about  school,  etc.  It  is  just  going  to  bring  a  revolution  of  persons  who  do  not  give  a  bit  of  care  for  succeeding  in  life.  It  is  just  a  form  for  self-enjoyment  that  should  not  be  enforced  or  allowed  in  any  fashion.	1
No.  But  banning  alcohol  is  a  good  start.  People  don't  realize  how  many  problems  alcohol  brings.	1
If  everyone  in  the  world  smoked  a  J  at  the  same  exact  time,  we'd  have  world  peace  for  two  hours...  or  at  least  I  think  I  saw  that  on  the  internet  once???	0

Well,  getting  rid  of  all  laws,  and  completely  dis  regarding  public  safety  and  making  sure  everyone  has  a  GREAT  TIME!  Then  yeah  it  would  work.  if  everyone  was  hooked,  then  we  would  all  be  in  some  kinda  haze,  and  everything  would  be  magic!!  Fantastic!  Obviously  suicide  would  be  at  an  all  time  high,  but  half  the  current  wars  would  no  longer  exist!  future  wars  to  come  could  be  averted!  yay	0
I  just  want  it  to  be  legalized  so  I  can  try  it....	0
Pos-a-lutely.  I  can  think  of  no  reason  not  to.  Although  I'd  love  to  see  what  the  other  side  has  to  say  and  if  anyone  actually  has  a  valid  point.	0
Do  you  have  any  evidence  that  legalizing  marijuana  would  cause  a  significant  increase  in  marijuana  use?  And  don't  try  to  "But  by  golly  it's  common  sense  don't  cha  know."      Any  evidence  that  it    wouldn't    cause  an  increase?  Come  on,  it  IS  common  sense,  which  is  almost  worthless  in  a  debate  so  it's  not  really  fare  is  it?        Also  driving  high  is  not  nearly  as  dangerous  as  you  think.  Incredibly  less  dangerous  than  driving  drunk.      How  dangerous  did  you  think  I  thought  it  was?  I  wasn't  saying  it  was  equal.  Just  that  we  shouldn't  add  to  a  problem.        I  am  merely  demonstrating  another  failure  in  your  chain  of  logic.      What  failure?  Like  I  said.  I  don't  think  that  driving  high  and  drunk  are  the  same.  But  they  are  both  bad.  And  will  happen  more  if  weed  id  legalized.          But  it  isn't  illegal  to  stay  up  for  three  nights  in  a  row  which  will  make  it  very  likely  for  you  to  fall  asleep  at  the  wheel.      Well  there's  that  common  sense  again.  Some  people  are  stupid.  It  should  be  illegal  to  drive  if  you  are  going  on  3  days  of  no  sleep.  But  thats  hard  to  enforce.  Laws  against  driving    high    on  the  other  hand,  is  not  as  tricky  to  enforce.        Your  arguments  are  bogus  and  based  upon  myths  and  social  stigma.

Kids  these  days  are  smoking  pot  like  crazy.  Elementary,  Middle,  and  High  schools.  Kids  think  there  cool  if  you  let  them  do  this.  Fine  thats  okay  if  they  think  that.  Are  kids  getting  hurt  from  doing  pot?  No.  Scientist  have  proved  that  smoking  pot  can  be  a  way  to  help  kids  and  there  systems  in  the  body.  There  is  an  effect  on  it  but  big  deal.  Obvioulsy  they  like  the  effect  or  else  they  wouldn't  do  it.	0

Considering  so  many  people  are  so  down  on  the  fact  that  cigarette  companies  even  exist  I  think  it  ridiculous  that  people  want  to  legalise  something  that  has  four  -  seven  times  the  amount  of  tar  (the  cancer  causing  agent)  in  one  cone  than  in  one  cigarette,  you  inhale  deeper,  hold  in  for  longer  and  lose  the  ability  to  make  proper  judgement,  drive  a  car,  or  become  paranoid,  or  if  your  lucky  enough  to  get  the  really  good  stuff,  think  you  are  dying.  And  if  it  was  legalised  you  could  guarantee  it  would  be  lower  in  THC.  If  you  want  to  smoke  legally,  go  for  a  trip  to  Amsterdam.  I'm  sure  there  are  alot  of  positive  aspects  such  as  taking  it  of  the  black  market  and  taxing  it  (monetarily)  and  do  agree  on  most  grounds,  but  if  you  take  a  look  at  the  outcome  in  the  long  run,  I  don't  feel  its  a  good  idea.  It  may  free  up  the  courts  from  drug  busts,  but  it  would  fill  the  courts  in  people  selling  to  the  underaged,as  with  cigarettes  and  alcohol,  people  suing  over  cancer  claims,  insurance  problems,  and  the  list  goes  on.  Also  I  don't  think  cops  are  evtremelly  hard  on  the  dope  smoker,  but  they  can  use  this  to  get  someone  off  the  streets  that  are  under  suspicion  of  other  harder  crimes.  I  say,  keep  it  illegal.	1
I  smoke  pot  occasionally.  I  rarely  smoke  outside  the  confines  of  my  home,  so  I  needn't  worry  about  getting  "busted".  Besides,  I  already  pay  way  too  much  and  if  the  government  gets  there  hands  in  on  it,  which  is  bound  to  happen  if  legalized,  I  would  also  have  to  pay  the  taxes  that  are  obviously  going  to  be  slapped  onto  it.  The  only  way  I  would  agree  is  if  you  could  grow  your  own.  I  don't  see  that  happening,  because  the  government  is  going  to  want  full  control  and  regulation  of  its  distribution.	1
Of  course  it  should,  it's  less  harmful  than  Alcohol  or  Ambien.      What's  good  is  that  more  and  more  politicians  are  supporting  the  idea  of  a  debate  on  the  issue  (well,  Arnold  Schwarzaneggar  is  the  most  vocal  right  now).  He  doesn't  say  legalize  it,  but  he  does  believe  it's  time  to  look  into  the  situation  and  see  if  it  should  be  legalized.  Way  better  than  pussy  ass  Obama  who  won't  even  discuss  the  reasons  why  he's  against  legalizing  it.  All  he  says  is  "that's  not  gonna  happen".

Annual  Causes  of  Death  in  the  United  States    Tobacco  435,000    Poor  Diet  and  Physical  Inactivity  365,000    Alcohol  85,000      Microbial  Agents  75,000    Toxic  Agents  55,000    Motor  Vehicle  Crashes  26,347    Adverse  Reactions  to  Prescription  Drugs  32,000    Suicide  30,622    Incidents  Involving  Firearms  29,000    Homicide  20,3084    Sexual  Behaviors  20,0001    All  Illicit  Drug  Use,  Direct  and  Indirect  17,000    Non-Steroidal  Anti-Inflammatory  Drugs  Such  As  Aspirin  7,600    Marijuana  0    Marijuana  suppresses  the  immune  system?    Like  the  studies  claiming  to  show  damage  to  the  reproductive  system,  this  myth  is  based  on  studies  where  animals  were  given  extremely  high-in  many  cases,  near-lethal-doses  of  cannabinoids.  These  results  have  never  been  duplicated  in  human  beings.  Interestingly,  two  studies  done  in  1978  and  one  done  in  1988  showed  that  hashish  and  marijuana  may  have  actually  stimulated  the  immune  system  in  the  people  studied.    Marijuana  is  much  more  dangerous  than  tobacco?      Smoked  marijuana  contains  about  the  same  amount  of  carcinogens  as  does  an  equivalent  amount  of  tobacco.  It  should  be  remembered,  however,  that  a  heavy  tobacco  smoker  consumes  much  more  tobacco  than  a  heavy  marijuana  smoker  consumes  marijuana.  This  is  because  smoked  tobacco,  with  a  90%  addiction  rate,  is  the  most  addictive  of  all  drugs  while  marijuana  is  less  addictive  than  caffeine;  like  soda  or  coffee.  Two  other  factors  are  important.  The  first  is  that  paraphernalia  laws  directed  against  marijuana  users  make  it  difficult  to  smoke  safely.  These  laws  make  water  pipes  and  bongs,  which  filter  some  of  the  carcinogens  out  of  the  smoke,  illegal  and,  hence,  unavailable.  The  second  is  that,  if  marijuana  were  legal,  it  would  be  more  economical  to  have  cannabis  drinks  like  bhang  (a  traditional  drink  in  the  Middle  East)  or  tea  which  are  totally  non-carcinogenic.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  with  "smokeless"  tobacco  products  like  snuff  which  can  cause  cancer  of  the  mouth  and  throat.  When  all  of  these  facts  are  taken  together,  it  can  be  clearly  seen  that  the  reverse  is  true:  marijuana  is  much  SAFER  than  tobacco,  that's  a  fact.      Is  there  are  over  a  thousand  chemicals  in  marijuana  smoke?    Again,  true  but  misleading.  The  31  August  1990  issue  of  the  magazine  Science  notes  that  of  the  over  800  volatile  chemicals  present  in  roasted  COFFEE,  only  21  have  actually  been  tested  on  animals  and  16  of  these  cause  cancer  in  rodents.  Yet,  coffee  remains  legal  and  is  generally  considered  fairly  safe.      .  NATURE  OF  MARIJUANA:  Marijuana  (derived  from  the  Cannabis  sativa  plant)  is  not  a  pure,  single-chemical  substance.  Marijuana  is  a  complex,  unstable  mixture  of  over  four  hundred  chemicals  that,  when  smoked,  produce  over  two  thousand  chemicals.      Is  there  a  thousand  chemicals  in  a  cup  of  coffee?    Yes!  Scientists  have  identified  over  1,000  different  chemicals  in  a  cup  of  coffee.  But  how  many  of  the  1,000  or  more  chemicals  have  been  tested  in  animal  cancer  studies?  Only  22--leaving  978  compounds  in  your  morning  java  about  which  we  know  very  little.  And  of  those  22  that  were  tested,  were  any  found  to  be  carcinogens,  or  cancer-causing  compounds?  Seventeen  of  the  22  are,  in  fact,  carcinogens.  Also  when  you  roast  your  cup  of  coffee  the  chemicals  get  in  bigger  numbers  to  over  1,500  chemicals  in  a  signal  cup  of  coffee.  Think  about  that  in  the  morning,  when  your  getting  your  hot  cup  of  coffee.    So  coffee  can  be  just  as  bad  and  good  as  weed  or  marijuana.  So  even  that  I  don't  smoke  it  at  all.  I  supported  because  its  has  no  reports  of  deaths  just  like  coffee  and  also  that  it  helps  people  stress,  which  is  a  big  factor  in  this  country.  Which  stress  can  cause  health  problems  to  the  heart  and  body.  Its  also  cuts  down  or  burns  of  body  fats  to  become  thinner  in  a  safer  way  then  tobacco  and  lose  weight  pills/drugs  that  can  hurt  you  that  could  case  death  faster,  when  there  is  no  record  death  ever  in  marijuana.  This  is  another  way  to  have  a  healthy  way  to  live  for  the  thousands  or  millions  can  used  marijuana  to  help  them.  So  people  that  disagree  about  this;  please  know  you  facts  before  you  go  say  something  that  you  have  no  clue  what  you  are  talking  about,  when  a  specially  I  go  to  college  and  learn  something  new  everyday.    Thank  you  for  your  time.	0

I  was  being  sarcastic.[SEP]Do  you  have  any  evidence  that  legalizing  marijuana  would  cause  a  significant  increase  in  marijuana  use?  And  don't  try  to  "But  by  golly  it's  common  sense  don't  cha  know."    Also  driving  high  is  not  nearly  as  dangerous  as  you  think.  Incredibly  less  dangerous  than  driving  drunk.  And  much  less  dangerous  than  driving  while  texting.  Unlike  you  I  am  actually  going  to  cite  a  study,  by  the  United  States  Department  of  Transportation  no  less:    “This  report  concerns  the  effects  of  marijuana  smoking  on  actual  driving  performance.  …  This  program  of  research  has  shown  that  marijuana,  when  taken  alone,  produces  a  moderate  degree  of  driving  impairment  which  is  related  to  consumed  THC  dose.  The  impairment  manifests  itself  mainly  in  the  ability  to  maintain  a  lateral  position  on  the  road,  but  its  magnitude  is  not  exceptional  in  comparison  with  changes  produced  by  many  medicinal  drugs  and  alcohol.  Drivers  under  the  influence  of  marijuana  retain  insight  in  their  performance  and  will  compensate  when  they  can,  for  example,  by  slowing  down  or  increasing  effort.  As  a  consequence,  THC’s  adverse  effects  on  driving  performance  appear  relatively  small.”    REFERENCE:  W.  Hindrik  and  J.  Robbe  and  J.  O’Hanlon.  1993.  Marijuana  and  actual  driving  performance.  Washington,  DC:  US  Department  of  Transportation  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration,  Report  No.  DOT  HS  808  078.    I  am  by  no  means  suggested  that  it  should  be  legal  to  drive  high.  I  am  merely  demonstrating  another  failure  in  your  chain  of  logic.    Marijuana  legalized  =&gt;  More  people  use  marijuana  =&gt;  More  people  drive  high  =&gt;  There  will  be  many  more  deaths  as  a  result    Hypothetically  speaking  even  if  marijuana  was  proven  to  cause  as  much  driving  impairment  as  alcohol,  this  would  still  not  be  grounds  for  it  to  be  illegal.  One  of  the  most  dangerous  things  to  do  while  driving  is  sleeping.  But  it  isn't  illegal  to  stay  up  for  three  nights  in  a  row  which  will  make  it  very  likely  for  you  to  fall  asleep  at  the  wheel.    Your  arguments  are  bogus  and  based  upon  myths  and  social  stigma.  I  will  gladly  debate  you  on  the  legalization  of  marijuana.	0

Absolutely,  with  restrictions  of  course.  I  don't  personally  use  it,  or  have  any  real  want  to,  but  I  don't  think  it's  any  worse  than  alcohol  or  cigarettes.	0
Yes.      Unfortunately,  President  Obama  has  lied  to  us  all.  He  says  that  he's  willing  to  keep  government  open  and  address  issues  that  we  find  the  most  important.  So  far,  the  number  one  concern  brought  up  by  the  internet  is  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  and  every  time  he  finds  a  way  to  dodge  it.  The  largest  petition  on  his  website  and  they  basically  tell  us  that  they're  going  to  do  nothing  and  will  not  give  us  a  straight  answer  on  why.    Obama  reminds  me  of  Reagan,  except  that  Reagan  just  didn't  like  weed  and  never  said  that  he  would  address  our  concerns  when  we  brought  them  up  (especially  in  such  numbers).      No,  more  like  Nixon,  a  liar  who  thinks  that  the  president  should  have  far  more  powers  than  delegated  by  the  Constitution.    Okay,  a  rant  about  Obama.  I  feel  like  I  need  to  get  my  negative  feelings  out  every  once  in  a  while  in  small  numbers  (as  opposed  to  just  being  objective  all  the  time).  And  since  weed  has  been  brought  up  on  this  site  so  many  times,  why  not  this  debate?	0
Political  reasons  are  the  ONLY  reason  that  this  drug  is  still  on  the  same  list  as  heroine.  Useful  both  as  a  medical  drug  and  a  recreational  one.  The  side  effects  are  not  as  severe  as  alcohol.  Marijauna  also  contains  less  harmful  chemicals  than  tobacco!	0
Making  it  illegal  turns  everyday  citizens  into  criminals.  The  winner  in  the  war  on  drugs  is  alcohol.  For  a  drug  that  is  in  some  ways  not  as  bad  as  alcohol,  some  ways  worse,  but  overall  about  on  the  same  level,  I  think  that  it  should  be  legalised.  As  mentioned  by  others,  making  it  legal  would  be  quite  easy  as  you  can  apply  the  same  laws  as  alcohol.  Drug  testing  for  drivers  is  now  just  as  easy  as  alcohol  testing  so  why  not?	0

The  medical  evidence  in  support  is  very  overwhelming,  and  Hemp  is  one  of  the  most  sustainable  crops  grown  throughout  history.      The  government  could  earn  billions  in  taxes,  shut  down  a  black  market,  regulate  quality,  we  can  make  everything  from  textiles  to  paper  to  carbon  fibre  out  of  hemp.    "In  1916,  USDA  Bulletin  No.  404,  reported  that  one  acre  of  cannabis  hemp,  in  annual  rotation  over  a  20-year  period,  would  produce  as  much  pulp  for  paper  as  4.1  acres  of  trees  being  cut  down  over  the  same  20-year  period.  This  process  would  use  only  1/4  to  1/7  as  much  polluting  sulfur-based  acid  chemicals  to  break  down  the  glue-like  lignin  that  binds  the  fibers  of  the  pulp,  or  even  none  at  all  using  soda  ash.  The  problem  of  dioxin  contamination  of  rivers  is  avoided  in  the  hemp  paper  making  process,  which  does  not  need  to  use  chlorine  bleach  (as  the  wood  pulp  paper  making  process  requires)  but  instead  safely  substitutes  hydrogen  peroxide  in  the  bleaching  process.  ...  If  the  new  (1916)  hemp  pulp  paper  process  were  legal  today,  it  would  soon  replace  about  70%  of  all  wood  pulp  paper,  including  computer  printout  paper,  corrugated  boxes  and  paper  bags."    From    http://www.jackherer.com/      $100,000  Challenge  to  Prove  Us  Wrong!    If  all  fossil  fuels  and  their  derivatives,  as  well  as  trees  for  paper  and  construction,  were  banned  in  order  to  save  the  planet,  reverse  the  Greenhouse  Effect  and  stop  deforestation;    then  there  is  only  one  known  annually  renewable  natural  resource  that  is  capable  of  providing  the  overall  majority  of  the  world's  paper  and  textiles;  meet  all  of  the  world's  transportation,  industrial  and  home  energy  needs,  while  simultaneously  reducing  pollution,  rebuilding  the  soil  and  cleaning  the  atmosphere  all  at  the  same  time...    and  that  substance  is  the  same  one  that  has  done  it  before  .  .

Marijuana  should  be  legalized  BECAUSE  it  is  dangerous.      If  'dangerous'  is  the  over-all  term  for  anything  that  might  shunt  one  from  his  formal,  initial,  eligible  state  of  his  body.  An  imaginary  state  of  fully-functioning,  flawless,  ideal  body.  Structured  by  psychology,  biology,  culture  and  all  kinds  of  institutions,  to  distinguish  sanity  from  lunacy,  health  from  illness,  intelligence  from  ignorance.  Though  these  are  not  the  bad  guys,  of  course,  it's  just  that  marijuana  does  change  you,  it  does  change  your  body,  the  way  you  think,  thus  the  dangerous  mark  is  understandable.      The  'high'  effect  is  an  abnormal  state  that  will  never  fit  it  with  the  standards.  in  fact,  it  changes  people  so  much  they  often  consider  upper  spiritual  intervention  and  skip  their  way  to  the  bible,  only  to  find  (or  intentionally  reinterpret)  juicy  quotes  of  Jesus  puffing  away  -  THESE  are  the  bad  guys.  These  people  underestimate  the  abyss  between  themselves  and  the  machine  that  produced  the  metaphors  they  use  to  explain  their  experience.      The  data  field  of  it's  effects  is  radically  shaped  by  the  method  of  learning  it,  thus  a  non-user  and  a  do-user  are  both  biased,  the  argument  between  the  two  always  hides  the  law  underneath  it,  which  separates  them  even  more.  The  point  is  that  some  day  the  do-user  won't  have  the  need  of  such  self-deceit,  just  like  most  of  us  manage  to  live  without  defying  the  meaning  of  life.    Stigma  dissolving  is  not  necessary,  maybe  not  even  possible,  the  stigma  is  not  a  merit  of  either  side  of  the  coin,  it  is  the  coin  itself,  the  need  to  justify  and  'OK'  stamping  one's  inevitable  position  on  either  side  demands  the  improvisation  of  rational  evidence  of  truth.      Once  a  full  legalization  is  executed,  there  might  be  a  radical  separation  and  a  birth-approval  for  new  culture,  new  moral,  new  rationalism  that  neutralizes  the  holiness  around  such  a  nihilistic  notion  of  'reasonable  behavior',  new  thought,  new  language,  new  engagement  with  whatever  is  or  is  not  considered  reality.  While  the  non-user  will  embrace  the  whole  coin  to  morph  it  into  a  monopoly  of  the  whole  opinion  spectrum  within  the  data  field  of  marijuana  study,  and  will  create  yet  another  standard,  unifying  abstainers  as  much  as  absence  of  activity  can  be  conceivable  as  a  common  denominator.      'Users'  will  consider  the  activity  as  we  all  consider  sugar,  it  just  won't  be  considered  at  all.	0
I'm  sorry.  I  can't  find  anything  of  value  in  this  argument.  I  say  this  to  be  realistic,  not  mean.      I'll  go  through  it  by  points.      "you  would  respect  my  point  of  view  as  a  faction  of  the  democratic  comity"    People  can  be  wrong,  yes?  That  is  why  we  debate...  Or  put  this  way:  In  a  debate,  your  "opinion"  (it  should  be  argument)  should  be  as  respected  as  much  as  it  is  powerful.  Democracy  has  nothing  to  do  with  this.      "When  I  say  that  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  what  I  mean  is  for  recreational  use.  Medicinal  use  is  fine..."    This  debate  is  listed  as:  "  'Informal  conversation'  on  medical  marijuana,"  but  from  here  on  I  will  consider  only  recreational  use.      "What  I  don't  like  about  weed,  is  what  it  does  to  people,  and  I  am  sure  this  is  the  reason  it  has  been  made  illegal  and  mainly,  why  it  has  stayed  illegal.  I  have  seen  the  original  arguments  against  it's  recreational  use,  and  I  think  that  is  absurd,  it  doesn't  make  you  crazy,  it  doesn't  make  you  blood  thirsty,  etc."    Um,  wow.  Ok...  The  fact  that  you  don't  like  weed  means  almost  nothing.  It  proves  nothing,  it  demonstrates  nothing.  Again,  your  opinion  is  not  valid  in  a  debate.  Plus  not  a  thing  that  you  are  saying  is  backed  up.  Let  me  paraphrase  you  to  demonstrate:  "Weed  is  bad  because  I  lose  respect  for  people  who  are  high.  I  feel  that  this  must  be  the  reason  it's  illegal,  simply  because  I  feel  like  it.  I've  heard  arguments  for  using  it  and  they  are  all  wrong."  I'm  not  trying  to  be  mean,  but  this  paragraph  is  worthless.  This  lists  only  your  feelings,  and  doesn't  actually  critique  any  arguments.  But,  let's  continue.    OK.  In  your  next  paragraph  you  do  not  demonstrate  how  pot  is  a  cancer  (matter-of-fact  it  reduces  cancer,  though  I  realize  that's  not  what  you  mean).  WHY  IS  POT  BAD  FOR  SOCIETY.  Just  saying  it  is  bad  for  society  is  not  informative  or  argumentatively  sound.  Also,  "Alcohol  use,  which  with  it  brings  tons  of  social  deviance  because  it's  a  mind  altering  drug."  While  alcohol  is  a  mind  altering  drug,  that  is  not  the  reason  it  brings  social  deviance.  That  is  a  fallacy.  There  are  other  things,  but  let's  continue...    The  next  paragraph  says  that  the  government  should  secure  domestic  peace.  (I'm  trying  to  make  what  you  said  correct,  because  that  is  not  the  only  function  of  government.)    The  next  one  is  all  wrong.  I  having  trouble  deciphering  it.  I  think  you  are  trying  to  say  that  the  government's  job  is  hard  cause  there  are  "many"  (try  thousands  if  not  more)  drugs  and  more  would  complicate  things.  The  problem  with  this  is  that  the  world  is  complicated,  and  you  have  not  argued  why  less  complication  (when  in  opposition  to  things  like  personal  freedom)  is  the  de  facto  standard.  Again,  you  have  in  no  way  backed  up  your  claim.  Also,  weed  is  already  a  complication  because  the  government  must  spend  MASSIVE  time  and  energy  trying  to  stop  it.  Honestly  I  think  it  would  be  less  complicated  if  it  were  legal.    In  the  next  paragraph,  you  are  concerned  because  more  people  will  smoke  and  maybe  do  it  in  public.  Again,  why  is  any  of  this  a  problem.  There  are  laws  now  that  you  cannot  drink  or  be  intoxicated  in  public  (except  in  designated  areas  like  bars...  Speaking  of  bars,  they  are  doing  quite  well  so  I'm  not  sure  why  you  believe  that  most  people  stay  home  to  drink).  There  is  nothing  stopping  laws  making  it  illegal  to  smoke  in  public.  Not  that  it  matters  cause  you  have  not  demonstrated  why  this  should  be  a  concern.    OK,  next.    sign    The  addictive  properties  of  a  substance  do  not  change  when  the  legality  of  a  substance  changes.  Also,  marijuana  truly  is  less  addictive  then  both  alcohol  and  nicotine.  If  necessary  I  will  provide  proof.      Next.  There  are  plenty  of  people  who  want  to  deal  with  this  subject,  as  evidenced  by  the  "hotness"  of  this  debate.  The  fact  that  you  do  not  wish  to  is  of  no  concern.  What  would  get  worse,  and  why/how  would  it  get  there  if  it  were  legalized.  Again  you  have  not  once  demonstrated  what  is  actually  wrong  with  marijuana  aside  from  the  fact  that  you  don't  like  it.    Skip  to  the  last  paragraph.  You  argue  that  "childish  and  petty  insults"  "suppress  the  voices  of  the  citizens."  And  you  argue  this...  This  is  actually  pretty  cool  because  you  have  made  yourself  a  demonstration  of  the  fallacy  of  your  argument...  Do  you  see?  You  have  spoke  your  "voice"  of  outrage  at  the  "childish  and  petty  insults"  that  prevent  you  from  speaking  your  voice.    I'm  truly  not  trying  to  insult  you,  but  your  skills  of  argumentation  are  very  poor.  I  would  suggest  taking  a  Logic  and  Critical  Thinking  course.[SEP]I  don't  think  the  legalization  of  marijuana  would  be  a  good  idea.      Why  does  everyone  push  so  hard  for  it,  when  all  it  does  is  make  you  high???    Talk  about  mindless  self  indulgence...  I  hate  people  who  have  problems  dealing  with  the  fact  that  they  cannot  always  have  what  they    want  .[SEP]That  point  of  view  is  very  scary.  You  think  the  government  should  be  able  to  control  your  personal  life  even  when  your  minding  your  own  business  and  hurting  no  one.  And  yet  also  allow  big  corporations  to  push  substances  more  deadly  than  marijuana  on  consumers  (Alcohol,  Tobacco,  Prescription  Drugs).      Legalization  is  about  the  fact  that  a  person  should  have  the  right  to  privacy  and  the  choice  to  live  their  lives  how  they  see  fit  as  long  as  they  hurt  no  one  else.  Consider  the  fact  that  prescription  drugs  have  become  the  number  one  killer  in  these  recent  years.  People  are  going  to  get  high  off  what  is  available;  why  restrict  them  to  things  that  are  more  dangerous.  And  why  criminalize  people  who  choose  to  use  natural  herbs  instead  of  stuff  created  in  laboratories.    Last  I  checked  America  was  a  country  of  liberty  and  freedom;  but  I  guess  that  doesn't  mean  the  same  thing  in  this  last  century.  The  founding  fathers  didn't  want  to  have  some  central  government  dictating  the  citizen's  daily  lives.  It  is  supposed  to  be  a  government  by  the  people  and  for  the  people.  And  most  importantly  under  the  law  of  the  constitution.  People  don't  want  anything  they  don't  deserve;  they  only  want  the  one  thing  supposedly  guaranteed  in  this  country;  Freedom.    Now  if  you  think  its  mindless  self  indulgence  to  want  freedom  than  you  must  be  a  fascist  or  a  communist  or  maybe  just  confused  and  controlled;  regardless  I  pity  you.[SEP]What  is  truly  pitiful  is  that  one  could  find  pity  and  fear  in  what  you  do  not  know.  I  use  your  post  as  supporting  evidence.        Now,  if  you're  realistically  thinking  about  this  issue,  and  not  in  Imagination  Land,  you  would  respect  my  point  of  view  as  a  faction  of  the  democratic  comity.  I  am  a  citizen  of  these  United  States  of  America,  and  I  know  what  that  means.      I  personally  have  no  concern  about  the  drug  itself  and  I  am  fully  aware  that  cigarettes  and  alcohol  are  more  dangerous,  but  legal.      When  I  say  that  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  what  I  mean  is  for  recreational  use.  Medicinal  use  is  fine  for  the  few  drugs  on  the  market  that  marijuana  could  (realistically)  replace.  Also,  I  actually  advocate  the  use  of  hemp  and  wish  America  would  get  with  the  program,  I  know  the  benefits  of  hemp  cloths  and  hemp  oils.      What  I  don't  like  about  weed,  is  what  it  does  to  people,  and  I  am  sure  this  is  the  reason  it  has  been  made  illegal  and  mainly,  why  it  has  stayed  illegal.  I  have  seen  the  original  arguments  against  it's  recreational  use,  and  I  think  that  is  absurd,  it  doesn't  make  you  crazy,  it  doesn't  make  you  blood  thirsty,  etc.        If  you  look  at  society  as  a  whole,  we  already  have  a  few  cancers  at  work.  Alcohol  use,  which  with  it  brings  tons  of  social  deviance  because  it's  a  mind  altering  drug.  Cigarettes,  for  the  economy  are  bad,  because  those  who  smoke  are  hopelessly  addicted  and  will  spend  money  on  cigarettes  before  spending  it  on  things  that  they  should  buy,  like  food  or  clothes.  Do  we  really,  at  this  point  need  another?  For  people  who  don't  drink,  and  for  people  who  don't  smoke  cigarettes?      Like  I  said,  think  about  it  realistically.  What  is  government  for?  Why  is  a  government  needed  at  all,  I  mean,  what  is  the  main  single  duty  of  a  government???    It  is  to  secure  domestic  peace  ,  before  anything  else,  that  is  what  a  government  does.  The  people  within  the  government  agree  to  be  controlled  for  peace.  If  someone  steps  out  of  line,  because  they  have  agreed  to  live  under  this  government,  are  held  to  the  same  rules  as  the  next.  No  one  steps  out  of  line,  and  we  have  a  perfectly  paired  society  to  it's  government.  Unfortunately  we,  as  humans,  cannot  have  this.        So  if  the  government  only  really  exists  to  secure  domestic  peace,  yet  we  already  have  a  number  of  drugs  out  there,  why  should  we  have  another  to  complicate  things  with.        Also,  you  have  to  imagine  that  weed  is  legal.  No  more  will  people  feel  the  need  to  be  home  when  stoned.  They  might  as  well  get  stoned  in  public.  Like  drinking,  especially  if  it  were  made  illegal,  people  would  take  their  beer  home  with  them,  and  drink  there,  most  people    do  ,  stay  home  and  drink.  If  it  were  illegal,  you  wouldn't  see  drunk  people  as  much  now  would  you?  I  highly  doubt  you  would.        Marijuana,  I  logically  think,  would  be  more  addicting  than  tobacco  and  alcohol  combined  if  it  were  made  legal  and  then  integrated  into  popular  culture,  as  tobacco  is.  You  get  more  for  less,  with  less  consequences...  what  a  dream,  right?  I  mean,  if  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization,  yet  I  would  still  do  it  if  it  were,  doesn't  that  mean  something???      It's  something  that  I  don't  want  to  deal  with,  and  I  think  a  lot  of  people  would  agree  with  me  on  this.  If  it  were  legalized,  it  would  only  get  worse.        That's  really  all  I  can  say  for  now,  and  sorry  if  it  wasn't  enough  to  satisfy  your  lack  of  understanding.        I  would  like  to  advise  you  that  ad  hominen  arguments  are  not  welcome  here.            You  are  on  a  website  that  allows  you  to  share  ideas  and  opinions.  Do  not  attack  people  for  their  opinions  because,  if  you  think  that  denying  the  legalization  of  marijuana  is  not  American,  you  are  doing  the  greater  evil  by  suppressing  the  voices  of  the  citizens  that  this  democracy  represents  by  using  childish  and  petty  insults.	0
You  say  that,  "What  I  don't  like  about  weed,  is  what  it  does  to  people,"  and  I  think  that's  exactly  why  people  like  it....  because  of  what  it  does  to  people  ;)[SEP]I  don't  think  the  legalization  of  marijuana  would  be  a  good  idea.

Marijuana  should  be  legalized  BECAUSE  it  is  dangerous.      If  'dangerous'  is  the  over-all  term  for  anything  that  might  shunt  one  from  his  formal,  initial,  eligible  state  of  his  body.  An  imaginary  state  of  fully-functioning,  flawless,  ideal  body.  Structured  by  psychology,  biology,  culture  and  all  kinds  of  institutions,  to  distinguish  sanity  from  lunacy,  health  from  illness,  intelligence  from  ignorance.  Though  these  are  not  the  bad  guys,  of  course,  it's  just  that  marijuana  does  change  you,  it  does  change  your  body,  the  way  you  think,  thus  the  dangerous  mark  is  understandable.      The  'high'  effect  is  an  abnormal  state  that  will  never  fit  it  with  the  standards.  in  fact,  it  changes  people  so  much  they  often  consider  upper  spiritual  intervention  and  skip  their  way  to  the  bible,  only  to  find  (or  intentionally  reinterpret)  juicy  quotes  of  Jesus  puffing  away  -  THESE  are  the  bad  guys.  These  people  underestimate  the  abyss  between  themselves  and  the  machine  that  produced  the  metaphors  they  use  to  explain  their  experience.      The  data  field  of  it's  effects  is  radically  shaped  by  the  method  of  learning  it,  thus  a  non-user  and  a  do-user  are  both  biased,  the  argument  between  the  two  always  hides  the  law  underneath  it,  which  separates  them  even  more.  The  point  is  that  some  day  the  do-user  won't  have  the  need  of  such  self-deceit,  just  like  most  of  us  manage  to  live  without  defying  the  meaning  of  life.    Stigma  dissolving  is  not  necessary,  maybe  not  even  possible,  the  stigma  is  not  a  merit  of  either  side  of  the  coin,  it  is  the  coin  itself,  the  need  to  justify  and  'OK'  stamping  one's  inevitable  position  on  either  side  demands  the  improvisation  of  rational  evidence  of  truth.      Once  a  full  legalization  is  executed,  there  might  be  a  radical  separation  and  a  birth-approval  for  new  culture,  new  moral,  new  rationalism  that  neutralizes  the  holiness  around  such  a  nihilistic  notion  of  'reasonable  behavior',  new  thought,  new  language,  new  engagement  with  whatever  is  or  is  not  considered  reality.  While  the  non-user  will  embrace  the  whole  coin  to  morph  it  into  a  monopoly  of  the  whole  opinion  spectrum  within  the  data  field  of  marijuana  study,  and  will  create  yet  another  standard,  unifying  abstainers  as  much  as  absence  of  activity  can  be  conceivable  as  a  common  denominator.      'Users'  will  consider  the  activity  as  we  all  consider  sugar,  it  just  won't  be  considered  at  all.[SEP]Very    very    good  argument.  Stav,  you  are  favored  and  friended  for  this.      I  still  hold  a  conservative  view  towards  it  though.  I  don't  mind  the  people  doing  it  illegality,  in  fact  the  legality  of  it  (or  almost  anything  else  for  that  matter)  has  little  to  do  with  my  opinion.      For  those  who  are  almost    blindly    opposing  because  of  their  fear  of  change  or  the  likes,  would  find  this  post  to  be  extremely  helpful.  I  wish  I  could  double  vote  you  up.	0

Marijuana  should  be  legalized  BECAUSE  it  is  dangerous.      If  'dangerous'  is  the  over-all  term  for  anything  that  might  shunt  one  from  his  formal,  initial,  eligible  state  of  his  body.  An  imaginary  state  of  fully-functioning,  flawless,  ideal  body.  Structured  by  psychology,  biology,  culture  and  all  kinds  of  institutions,  to  distinguish  sanity  from  lunacy,  health  from  illness,  intelligence  from  ignorance.  Though  these  are  not  the  bad  guys,  of  course,  it's  just  that  marijuana  does  change  you,  it  does  change  your  body,  the  way  you  think,  thus  the  dangerous  mark  is  understandable.      The  'high'  effect  is  an  abnormal  state  that  will  never  fit  it  with  the  standards.  in  fact,  it  changes  people  so  much  they  often  consider  upper  spiritual  intervention  and  skip  their  way  to  the  bible,  only  to  find  (or  intentionally  reinterpret)  juicy  quotes  of  Jesus  puffing  away  -  THESE  are  the  bad  guys.  These  people  underestimate  the  abyss  between  themselves  and  the  machine  that  produced  the  metaphors  they  use  to  explain  their  experience.      The  data  field  of  it's  effects  is  radically  shaped  by  the  method  of  learning  it,  thus  a  non-user  and  a  do-user  are  both  biased,  the  argument  between  the  two  always  hides  the  law  underneath  it,  which  separates  them  even  more.

And  since  we  are  not  entirely  sure  we  know  the  entire  set  of  pluses  and  minuses  (due  to  the  fact  that  it  is  new)  we  can't  assign  a  value  to  those  pluses  and  minuses  thus  we  can't  be  sure  if  it's  better  or  not.  This  uncertainty  creates  fear  and  fear  holds  us  back  from  moving  forward.  But  this  fear  is  not  necessarily  bad  because  it  may  be  keeping  us  from  moving  forward  into  quicksand.  I  guess  in  the  end  we  wont  really  know  until  we  try  it.

It  should  be  legalized.  We  need  to  strive  for  a  rational  legal  code.  In  relation  to  tobacco  and  alcohol,  two  of  the  legal  drugs,  cannabis  is  hands  down  the  least  harmful.  It  does  not  have  the  physically  addictive  properties  of  either  alcohol  or  tobacco,  cannabis  users  can  stop  anytime  with  withdrawal  symptoms  on  par  with  or  less  than  that  of  caffeine  withdrawal.  More  than  that,  tens  of  thousands  of  people  die  every  year  from  lung  cancer  and  alcohol  related  accidents  and  illnesses.  If  your  an  alcoholic  you  can  die  if  you  just  stop  drinking.  No  one  to  my  knowledge  has  ever  been  killed  from  smoking  or  quiting  cannabis.  In  addition,  cannabis  has  not  been  shown  to  have  the  carcinogenic  effects  that  tobacco  has.  Cannabis  has  even  been  shown  to  promote  new  brain  cell  development,  and  its  users  report  wide  ranging  benefits.

Yes.  Prohibition  doesn't  work.  The  most  effective  way  to  make  something  irresistible  is  to  forbid  it.	0
Marijuana  being  illegal  is  part  of  the  reason  why  people  do  it.  It  is  a  stupid  reason,  but  a  reason  nonetheless.  Legalizing  marijuana,  could  potentially  lower  the  number  of  users.  The  thrill  of  the  chance  of  being  caught  gives  them  a  high  that's  intensified  by  the  drug.  It  outta  just  be  legalized,  and  the  government  can  tax  the  hell  out  of  it  like  with  cigarettes.  It's  your  choice  if  you're  going  to  do  it  or  not.	0
It  shouldnt  have  been  outlawed  in  the  first  place.  Its  not  the  goverments  job  to  tell  me  what  natural  and  organic  items  I  can  put  in  my  body.	0
Prohibition  has  been  unsuccessful  many  times  in  history,  just  look  at  what  happened  during  alcohol  prohibition.  It  causes  crime  to  go  up  because  of  the  fact  that  it  is  illegal.  The  black  market  profits  go  way  up  because  you  can't  legally  obtain  it,  which  causes  violent  crime  to  increase  because  of  the  existence  of  the  black  market.  Prohibiting  drugs  also  makes  it  "forbidden  fruit"  and  taboo,  which  is  a  big  reason  a  high  number  of  teenagers  and  young  adults  use  drugs.    Doing  drugs  is  a  victimless  crime  and  it  should  be  a  person's  choice  what  they  put  in  their  own  body,  not  the  government's  choice.	0

I'm  definitely  for  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  but  there's  something  people  need  to  realize.    Just  like  with  Tobacco,  when  Cannabis  is  legalized  and  FDA  regulated,  I  can  promise  you  the  commercialized  Marijuana  product  will  be  just  as  laden  with  polutants,  chemicals  and  pure  garbage  as  cigarettes  are.  It  will  become  more  expensive  because  there  will  be  a  tax  on  it,  just  as  there  is  with  tobacco  and  alcohol.  It  will  become  another  government  controlled  commodity.      That's  why  it's  not  legal.      People  die  from  drinking  home  made  alcohol/moonshine.  That  has  to  be  regulated,  period.  Tobacco  isn't  addictive  and  isn't  as  satisfying  or  nerve  calming  without  all  the  additives,  hence  it's  alteration  from  natural  form.      Marijuana  is  grown  in  backyards  all  over  the  world  and  needs  no  alteration  from  government  entities  for  it  to  be  popular  or  effective.  There's  no  logical  way  for  the  United  States  government  to  intervene,  control  and  PROFIT  (key  words  here)  from  the  potential  Marijuana  industry.	0
As  the  dutch  example  shows,  legalizing  marijuana  doesn't  come  with  any  significant  negative  effects  to  society.  Instead,  the  government  has  an  additional  source  of  income  from  taxes  and  saves  significant  amounts  of  money  that  is  currently  being  spent  on  arresting,  prosecution  and  locking  up  non  violent  marijuana  users.	0
When  it  comes  to  my  point  of  view  on  the  legalization  of  Marijuana  I  believe  that  there  is  no  reason  what  so  ever  for  it  to  remain  illegal.    I'm  not  going  to  go  into  detail  explaining  what  many  have  already  said,  about  the  medical  uses,  stress  relief,  etc,  but  when  it  comes  to  the  profit  that  could  be  made  this  way,  an  enormous  amount  of  opportunities  open  up.    First  thing  that  comes  to  mind  with  the  legal  sale  of  Marijuana  is  tax.  Why  have  a  tax  other  then  sales  tax?  Hell,  why  not?  Are  you  not  willing  to  pay  that  extra  amount  to  be  able  to  legally  smoke?  Is  that  extra  tax  not  worth  being  able  to  sit  in  clear  view  and  toke  it  up  without  worrying  about  going  to  jail  if  you're  caught?  Of  course  it  is!    Realistically,  we  could  add  the  Cigarette  tax  from  each  state  onto  a  package  of  Joints.  4  average  rolled  joints  at  $10  +  tax.  Sure,  you're  getting  slightly  less  than  a  dime's  worth,  but  again,  that  extra  amount  is  more  than  worth  it.    If  marijuana  was  to  be  considered  for  legalization,  and  lets  say  they  were  to  use  Texas  as  the  Beta-State,  a  package  of  4  joints  would  cost  $11.41  after  tax.  Lets  say  Joe  goes  through  the  average  dime  in  about  2  days.  That's  178  dime  bags  in  a  year.  As  of  now  that  would  cost  him  $1780,  and  it  would  cost  $2030.98  if  it  was  legalized  and  taxed.  That  is  $250.98  more  than  he  would  normally  pay  for  a  slightly  less  amount  of  weed.  About  .1  gram  per  package  to  be  exact,  on  average.    That  is  $250.98  in  profit  to  the  government,  in  1  year,  from  1  man.  That  means  slightly  under  4000  people  (3985)  would  allow  the  government  to  make  a  profit  of  one  million  dollars.    Did  I  mention  that  is  in  addition  to  the  money  saved  yearly  on  arrest  and  court  costs?  Imagine  this...  6458  (adjusted  for  the  California  cigarette  tax)  people  in  California  smoke  marijuana  once  it  has  become  legalized.  That's  $1  million  in  profit,  in  addition  to  saving  the  $100  million  that  it  is  estimated  to  spend  yearly  on  arrest  and  court  costs.  I'm  failing  to  see  the  problem  with  this  idea.    On  a  large  scale,  I  think  I  read  somewhere  about  10%  of  the  American  population  admitted  to  smoking  marijuana.  The  last  estimated  count  was  about  303.8  million  people  in  the  US,  so  30.38  million  have  admitted  to  regular  use.  The  average  tax  on  cigarettes  around  the  US  is  about  $.53  per  pack,  at  even  just  1  dime  per  week,  equals  to  an  average  profit  of  $837.27  million  dollars  annually.    This  estimate  does  not  include  the  millions  of  Americans  who  did  not  admit  to  their  regular  use,  nor  to  the  hundreds  of  millions  that  would  be  saved  on  arrest  and  court  costs.    In  addition,  think  of  all  the  new  job  openings  of  adding  several  large  scale  marijuana  plantations.  Hundreds  of  job  possibilities  open  up,  allowing  the  percentage  of  jobless  adults  to  decrease.  Hell,  make  a  few  new  college  courses  about  Marijuana  History,  Growing  Marijuana,  the  Cultivation  of  Marijuana.  Easily  opening  up  new  job  opportunities  for  people  to  strive  for.  Sure,  it's  not  the  perfect  job,  but  if  you  can  convince  people  to  go  to  school  for  it,  and  make  a  college  degree  required  to  work  on  the  plantation,  I  bet  it  would  convince  hundreds  of  students  to  return  to  school  with  their  career  choice  in  mind.    All  of  these  are  just  estimates  and  I  have  no  way  of  knowing  any  exacts.  But  as  my  estimates  are  reasonable,  and  pretty  close  to  being  exact  with  the  information  I've  researched,  even  if  it  didn't  provide  an  adequate  source  to  replace  paper  products,  or  medical  uses,  or  any  of  the  other  dozen  +  things  that  marijuana  is  useful  for,  the  profit  in  taxes  and  the  annual  savings  in  court  costs  and  the  job  opportunities  more  than  justify  the  legalization  of  marijuana.	0

First  thing  that  comes  to  mind  with  the  legal  sale  of  Marijuana  is  tax.  Why  have  a  tax  other  then  sales  tax?  Hell,  why  not?  Are  you  not  willing  to  pay  that  extra  amount  to  be  able  to  legally  smoke?  Is  that  extra  tax  not  worth  being  able  to  sit  in  clear  view  and  toke  it  up  without  worrying  about  going  to  jail  if  you're  caught?  Of  course  it  is!    Realistically,  we  could  add  the  Cigarette  tax  from  each  state  onto  a  package  of  Joints.  4  average  rolled  joints  at  $10  +  tax.  Sure,  you're  getting  slightly  less  than  a  dime's  worth,  but  again,  that  extra  amount  is  more  than  worth  it.    If  marijuana  was  to  be  considered  for  legalization,  and  lets  say  they  were  to  use  Texas  as  the  Beta-State,  a  package  of  4  joints  would  cost  $11.41  after  tax.  Lets  say  Joe  goes  through  the  average  dime  in  about  2  days.  That's  178  dime  bags  in  a  year.  As  of  now  that  would  cost  him  $1780,  and  it  would  cost  $2030.98  if  it  was  legalized  and  taxed.  That  is  $250.98  more  than  he  would  normally  pay  for  a  slightly  less  amount  of  weed.  About  .1  gram  per  package  to  be  exact,  on  average.    That  is  $250.98  in  profit  to  the  government,  in  1  year,  from  1  man.  That  means  slightly  under  4000  people  (3985)  would  allow  the  government  to  make  a  profit  of  one  million  dollars.    Did  I  mention  that  is  in  addition  to  the  money  saved  yearly  on  arrest  and  court  costs?  Imagine  this...  6458  (adjusted  for  the  California  cigarette  tax)  people  in  California  smoke  marijuana  once  it  has  become  legalized.  That's  $1  million  in  profit,  in  addition  to  saving  the  $100  million  that  it  is  estimated  to  spend  yearly  on  arrest  and  court  costs.  I'm  failing  to  see  the  problem  with  this  idea.    On  a  large  scale,  I  think  I  read  somewhere  about  10%  of  the  American  population  admitted  to  smoking  marijuana.  The  last  estimated  count  was  about  303.8  million  people  in  the  US,  so  30.38  million  have  admitted  to  regular  use.  The  average  tax  on  cigarettes  around  the  US  is  about  $.53  per  pack,  at  even  just  1  dime  per  week,  equals  to  an  average  profit  of  $837.27  million  dollars  annually.    This  estimate  does  not  include  the  millions  of  Americans  who  did  not  admit  to  their  regular  use,  nor  to  the  hundreds  of  millions  that  would  be  saved  on  arrest  and  court  costs.    In  addition,  think  of  all  the  new  job  openings  of  adding  several  large  scale  marijuana  plantations.  Hundreds  of  job  possibilities  open  up,  allowing  the  percentage  of  jobless  adults  to  decrease.  Hell,  make  a  few  new  college  courses  about  Marijuana  History,  Growing  Marijuana,  the  Cultivation  of  Marijuana.  Easily  opening  up  new  job  opportunities  for  people  to  strive  for.  Sure,  it's  not  the  perfect  job,  but  if  you  can  convince  people  to  go  to  school  for  it,  and  make  a  college  degree  required  to  work  on  the  plantation,  I  bet  it  would  convince  hundreds  of  students  to  return  to  school  with  their  career  choice  in  mind.    All  of  these  are  just  estimates  and  I  have  no  way  of  knowing  any  exacts.  But  as  my  estimates  are  reasonable,  and  pretty  close  to  being  exact  with  the  information  I've  researched,  even  if  it  didn't  provide  an  adequate  source  to  replace  paper  products,  or  medical  uses,  or  any  of  the  other  dozen  +  things  that  marijuana  is  useful  for,  the  profit  in  taxes  and  the  annual  savings  in  court  costs  and  the  job  opportunities  more  than  justify  the  legalization  of  marijuana.[SEP]Not  only  would  we  make  all  that  money  in  tax  revenue  but  people  would  be  so  high  that  they  wouldn't  care  about  the  economy  anymore  ;)	0
The  legalization  of  marigunana  will  come  with  pros  and  cons.  At  the  end  of  the  day  whether  it  is  legal  or  not  people  have  the  choice  to  have  marijuana.  They  should  legalize  it  and  control  it  how  they  have  alchohol  established.	0
Good  things  if  we  legalized  it  (in  the  U.S.):    If  it  was  legal  the  government  could  regulate  it  and  it  could  be  dispensed  safely.  This  would  stop  people  from  dying  when  their  drugs  have  been  modified  in  an  unhealthy  way.  Second,  we  could  tax  the  heck  out  of  it.  It's  not  the  best  solution,  but  it  would  help  curb  the  government's  budget  problems.  What  about  Industrial  Hemp?  That  would  help  create  a  billion  dollar  industry,  hence  more  jobs,  and  more  money  if  the  US  exports  and  or  imports  it  to  different  countries.    Hemp  is  good  for  as  a  alternative  fuel,  food,  clothing,  paper,  etc.  That  would  help  our  environment  greatly.  Why  cut  down  trees  that  takes  over  80  years  to  fully  grow  while  you  can  use  hemp  that  fully  grows  per  season?What  about  the  waste  of  tax  payers  money  called  the  war  on  drugs?  It's  a  completely  useless  program  that  helps  create  more  chaos  by  making  drug  cartels  being  stinking  rich,  do  you  really  want  the  drug  cartels  to  have  such  power?    Bad  things:    Marijuana  is  proven  to  cause  depression  and  change  brain  patterns  in  odd  ways  among  other  things.  But  there  are  many  worse  drugs.  However  if  Marijuana  was  legalized  there  would  be  a  push  to  legalize  other  drugs.  Things  like  Meth  and  Estacy  could  be  legalized,  then  we  could  say  goodbye  to  civilization  as  we  know  it.  Even  if  other  drugs  werent  legalized  after,  Marijuana  its  still  a  gateway  to  a  high  feeling.  And  many,  too  many,  will  want  to  move  on  to  larger  highs,  to  drugs  which  have  undoubtedly  negative  effects,  to  drugs  which  will  annihilate  your  ability  to  think  and  function.      So,  in  the  end,  my  thoughts  are  not  to  legalize  it,  but  to  decriminalize  it.  It  could  be  decriminalized  for  say,  a  personal  amount.  If  you're  caught  over  that  amount  you  receive  a  fine.  Charging  and  convicting  people  for  personal  amounts  is  a  waste  of  tax  money  and  court  time.  Nobody  has  ever  died  directly  related  to  marijuana.  Nor  does  is  it  cause  much  society  problems  unlike  alcohol  and  hard  drugs.	0
Do  not  be  fooled  by  the  multi-party  politricks  system  which  is  often  tied  to  selfish  gain  and  short  term  ends.  Which  like  the  ancient  kingdom  of  babylon  seeks  to  impose  its  views  by  force  at  the  expense  of  the  majority  to  benefit  the  minority.  Many  of  those  in  position  of  power  to  regulate  laws  are  often  helped  along  the  way  financially  by  the  fat  pockets  of  alcohol  and  tobacco  lobbyists,  whose  industry  continues  to  thrive  because  of  their  economic  dominance  which  is  being  used  to  suppress  the  tree  of  life  (marijuana),  which  if  became  legal  would  affect  the  corruption  drastically  on  alcohol  and  tobacco  which  have  been  proven  by  medical  research  to  pose  a  far  greater  threat  to  the  health  and  well  being  of  the  population  in  comparison  to  the  the  healing  herb  of  cannabis.  So  no  I  will  not  drink  the  cup  of  devils,  but  will  continue  to  partake  of  the  healing  herb  of  marijuana  which  makes  life  pleasant  even  in  the  most  trying  conditions,  for  the  life  experience  itself  has  manifested  my  legal  right  protected  through  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  which  upholds  the  noblest  aspirations  of  man  without  any  distinction  of  race,  sex  ,  language  and  religion.  My  right  is  my  right,  just  as  a  man  has  a  right  to  drink  wine  or  beer,  which  consequently  is  often  brewed  with  Humulus  lupulus  (the  hop  plant)  which  only  it  and  cannabis  are  of  the  same  herbaceous  plant  group  of  Cannabaceae.      'Wine  is  a  mocker,  strong  drink  is  raging:  and  whosoever  is  deceived  thereby  is  not  wise'  Proverbs  20:1    "Since  in  the  scale  of  creation  all  men  are  born  equal,  it  is  imperitive  that  all  laws  should  be  equitable  in  their  application,  for  what  is  the  foundation  of  freedom  and  the  reasons  that  men  cherish  it,  if  they  are  not  equal  before  the  law.  The  answer  is  clear  to  all  of  you."  HIM  Haile  Selassie  I	0

As  the  dutch  example  shows,  legalizing  marijuana  doesn't  come  with  any  significant  negative  effects  to  society.  Instead,  the  government  has  an  additional  source  of  income  from  taxes  and  saves  significant  amounts  of  money  that  is  currently  being  spent  on  arresting,  prosecution  and  locking  up  non  violent  marijuana  users.[SEP]that's  cool,  except  the  tax  part.  Why  is  government  owed  a  tax  for  the  growth  or  sale  of  this  particular  plant?  We  don't  have  special  taxes  for  coffee,  which  is  about  the  equivalent  in  overall  social  effect  and  harm-potential  (that  is,  almost  zero).    There's  nothing  that  justifies  that  marijuana  be  subjected  to  anything  other  than  standard  sales  taxes.	0

Consider  my  eyes  rolled.  If  you  want  to  talk  about  gateway  drugs,  let's  talk  about  alcohol  and  tobacco,  the  two  legal,  harmful  drugs  that  lead  people  to  try  other  ones.      "There  are  many  people  who  don't  smoke  pot  because  it  is  illegal"--This  is  an  argument  for  the  efficacy  of  prohibition,  which,  if  we're  being  honest,  is  fairly  ineffective.  I  could  just  as  easily  argue  there  are  many  people  who  smoke  pot  in  spite  of  it  being  illegal.  Does  either  argument  address  whether  or  not  it  ought  to  be  legalized?  No.      Marijuana  has  no  business  being  illegal  when  it  is  less  harmful  than  alcohol,  a  drug  that  is  not  only  legal  but  used  by  a  large  portion  of  the  population.  Alcohol  poisoning  kills  people  every  year,  as  does  drunk  driving.  Marijuana  cannot  be  overdosed  on,  nor  does  it  make  people  over-confident  or  belligerent.      The  latest  marijuana  ads  have  been  more  accurate  than  in  years  past.  "We  didn't  shoot  anybody.  We  just  sat  on  Pete's  couch".  Granted,  the  point  is  made,  marijuana  users  are  less  likely  to  be  active.  Then  again,  we  could  make  the  same  argument  about  cable  television  watchers,  couldn't  we?	0

I'm  not  that  concerned  with  Marijuana.  I'd  never  use  it,  and  I  don't  let  my  boyfriend  either.  I  think  it  is  a  cop-out  and  a  rather  stupid  thing  to  get  into.      I  don't  mind  it  being  legalized,  though  I'd  rather  it  not.  I'd  even  go  so  far  as  to  say  alcohol  shouldn't  be  legal  either.      I  don't,  however,  like  the  way  these  things  are  prosecuted.  I'd  rather  see  users  treated  like  those  in  need  of  medical  and  psychological  attention.  There  shouldn't  be  anything  on  their  permanent  records,  they  shouldn't  go  to  jail  or  prison,  and  they  shouldn't  be  stigmatized.      Users  should  be  sent  through  rehabilitative  structures  and  helped  to  find  better  ways  to  spend  their  time  and  money.  Educating  themselves,  expanding  their  minds,  getting  good  jobs,  having  fun  in  more  productive  ways.  Users  should  be  helped  towards  a  better,  happier  life  without  the  need  for  mind  altering  chemicals.      Pushers,  however,  are  a  different  matter.

They  should  be  punished,  with  jail  time  and  prison  time  (depending  on  what  they  did  and  how  they  did  it)  followed  by  rehabilitation  and  job  training/higher  education.	1

I  agree  though,  for  some  odd  reason  (and  I've  put  way  more  thought  into  the  issue  than  I  apparently  should  have)  don't  like  the  idea  of  legalization.  Then  again,  I  do  know  that  once  someone  covets  something,  the  first  thing  I  want  to  do  is  keep  it  from  them  because  I  believe  anything  that  is  "coveted"  cannot  be  a  good  thing  for  them...    Er,  you  can  see  my  arguments...  they  aren't  pretty  :^/.    I  don't  know,  I  get  the  idea  that  this  somehow  has  to  do  with  morals  or  ethics,  but  it's  only  a  feeling  and  when  it  comes  down  to  it,  my  "practical"  side  says  that  it    should    be  legalized,  but  still,  I  don't  like  people  doing  it...  which  is  not  the  case  with  drinking.    So  why  do  you  think  that  people    shouldn't  ?	1
I'm  not  that  concerned  with  Marijuana.  I'd  never  use  it,  and  I  don't  let  my  boyfriend  either.  I  think  it  is  a  cop-out  and  a  rather  stupid  thing  to  get  into.      I  don't  mind  it  being  legalized,  though  I'd  rather  it  not.  I'd  even  go  so  far  as  to  say  alcohol  shouldn't  be  legal  either.      I  don't,  however,  like  the  way  these  things  are  prosecuted.  I'd  rather  see  users  treated  like  those  in  need  of  medical  and  psychological  attention.  There  shouldn't  be  anything  on  their  permanent  records,  they  shouldn't  go  to  jail  or  prison,  and  they  shouldn't  be  stigmatized.      Users  should  be  sent  through  rehabilitative  structures  and  helped  to  find  better  ways  to  spend  their  time  and  money.  Educating  themselves,  expanding  their  minds,  getting  good  jobs,  having  fun  in  more  productive  ways.  Users  should  be  helped  towards  a  better,  happier  life  without  the  need  for  mind  altering  chemicals.      Pushers,  however,  are  a  different  matter.  Small-timer  pusher  and  pushers  of  less  dangerous  drugs  should  go  through  the  same  services.  But  people  selling  deadly,  horribly  destructive  drugs  to  people  are  partially  responsible  for  their  downward  spiral.  They  should  be  punished,  with  jail  time  and  prison  time  (depending  on  what  they  did  and  how  they  did  it)  followed  by  rehabilitation  and  job  training/higher  education.[SEP]You  cannot  say  that  because  you'd  rather  not,  it  shouldn't  be  legalized.  I  agree  though,  for  some  odd  reason  (and  I've  put  way  more  thought  into  the  issue  than  I  apparently  should  have)  don't  like  the  idea  of  legalization.  Then  again,  I  do  know  that  once  someone  covets  something,  the  first  thing  I  want  to  do  is  keep  it  from  them  because  I  believe  anything  that  is  "coveted"  cannot  be  a  good  thing  for  them...    Er,  you  can  see  my  arguments...  they  aren't  pretty  :^/.    I  don't  know,  I  get  the  idea  that  this  somehow  has  to  do  with  morals  or  ethics,  but  it's  only  a  feeling  and  when  it  comes  down  to  it,  my  "practical"  side  says  that  it    should    be  legalized,  but  still,  I  don't  like  people  doing  it...  which  is  not  the  case  with  drinking.    So  why  do  you  think  that  people    shouldn't  ?[SEP]The  reason  I  don't  like  marijuana,  alcohol,  hard  drugs,  and  certain  kinds  of  prescription  medications  is  rather  simple:  I  don't  think  people  should  sacrifice  who  they  are,  in  some  cases  their  free  will  or  their  humanity.      When  someone  gives  up  their  free  will  by  becoming  a  slave  to  a  hard  drug  or  prescription  mood  and  personality  altering  chemicals  it  is  time  for  society  to  step  in  and  give  them  back  control.    Marijuana  may  be  a  petty  offender,  much  less  of  an  offender  than  alcohol,  tobacco,  meth,  cocaine..etc..,  but  it  is  still  a  means  of  giving  up  who  you  are  or  keeping  yourself  in  a  state  of  non-growth.      We,  as  human  beings,  have  a  duty  to  ourselves  to  grow,  change,  improve,  but  always  in  the  context  of  who  we  are.  Drugs  are  a  way  to  retard  this  development,  deny  who  we  are,  and  cope  with  a  world  that  rejects  us.  It  is  an  escape;  an  escape  which  noone  deserves.      I  don't  mind  people  escaping  in  other  ways:  video  games,  reading,  television,  camping..etc,  at  least  they  are  still  thinking,  at  least  their  self  is  still  intact  and  operating.      When  people  do  drugs  they  stop  being  people  and  start  being  Mr.  or  Ms.  X+meth,  or  X+Marijuana,  or  X+alcohol.  It  isn't  helpful;  it's  downright  harmful  in  the  long-run.      Governments  and  societies  are  meant  to  protect  us;  usually  from  dangers  outside.  This  danger,  this  threat  is  unique  in  its  internal,  self-inflicted  nature.      Again,  Marijuana  is  only  a  petty  offender  in  this  case;  which  is  why  I  am  not  adamant  about  its  status  as  an  illegal  narcotic.  There  are  far  worse  legal  drugs  which  I  am  much  more  concerned  with.      Does  that  help  in  explaining  my  objection  to  its  use?  I  am  still  forming  my  opinion  on  this  one  so  I  know  my  logic  is  abit  choppy  and  in  some  cases  exaggerated.	1

Did  you  know  that  if  cannabis  were  legalized  that  it  could  replace  the  lumber  industry  with  a  renewable,  green  house  resource?  It  requires  no  pesticides  to  grow,  the  pesticides  companies  don't  like  that.  Big  lumber  are  the  guys  who  got  the  crop  made  illegal  back  in  1937.  Crashes  under  impairment  would  likely  go  down,  as  many  bars  might  adopt  marijuana  instead  of  alcohol.  Orp  people  might  start  smoking  instead  of  drinking.  Studies  have  shown  that  impairment  while  driving  (while  not  encouraged  ,and  should  have  a  limit,  like  alcohol.  Keep  in  mind  we  didn't  develop  one  before  re-legalizing  it  in  1937.)  Other  studies  show  that  cannabis  going  illegal  at  the  same  time  alcohol  became  legal  again  was  a  gift  to  organized  crime.    See,  organized  crime  didn't  exist  the  way  it  did  (or  at  all)  before  alcohol  prohibition.  That  literally  changed  the  face  of  our  nation.  Marijuana  and  other  drug  prohibition  changed  everything  as  well.  It  (marijuana)  is  responsible  for  70%  of  Drug  Cartel  income.  We  can  end  that  with  legalization.    Industrial  benefits  of  hemp:  Can  make  2x4  and  other  building  material  that  is  2-4x  stronger  than  wood.  Lasts  longer.    25,000  different  products,  5,000  known  textiles  (That  was  in  1938!).  They  are  looking  into  making  polymer  with  it.  Like  those  high  grade  plastics  used  in,  well,  almost  everything.  From  guns  to  blow  dryers,  etc.  etc.  This  would  make  a  more  environmentally-friendly  version.    Same  with  paper,  our  Constitution  is  written  on  hemp  paper.  George  Washington  smoked  hemp,  and  grew  it,  even  telling  others  to  do  it.  Benjamin  Franklin  had  a  hemp  paper  mill.  And  news  press.  Hemp  paper  is  the  highest  quality  paper  in  the  world.  And  completely  renewable  and  eco-friendly.  Industrial  hemp  can  be  grown  en-mass  with  very  little  THC,  making  thieves  unlikely.  Plus  it  could  be  grown  as  a  number  one  cash  crop  from  Cali  to  Utah  to  Nebraska  and  most  of  the  Bible-belt  states.    Did  I  mention  you  can  build  the  body  for  a  car  using  hemp  polymer?  Even  space  shuttles  and  planes!  Then  you  can  fuel  them  using  hemp-fuel  that  has  ZERO  carbon  emissions.    "Why  isn't  it  legal  if  it's  so  great?"  You  ask?  Well,  it's  simple.  Big  biz,  Pharm,  Tobacco  (although  they  will  be  changing  their  mind,  surely),  alcohol,  lumber,  oil,  people  who  in  the  pocket  of  the  cartels,  etc.  Don't  want  that.  Enough  of  them  got  enough  people  tricked  to  keep  this  going  for  years.    Recent  tests  also  show  that  smoking  or  inhaling,  or  otherwise  ingesting  cannabis  can  increase  your  brain  cell  growth.  In  40  years  of  constant  usage  no  user  of  just  marijuana  has  ever  gotten  cancer  or  otherwise  ill  effects.  Something  would  have  shown  up.

Then  again,  I  do  know  that  once  someone  covets  something,  the  first  thing  I  want  to  do  is  keep  it  from  them  because  I  believe  anything  that  is  "coveted"  cannot  be  a  good  thing  for  them...    Er,  you  can  see  my  arguments...  they  aren't  pretty  :^/.    I  don't  know,  I  get  the  idea  that  this  somehow  has  to  do  with  morals  or  ethics,  but  it's  only  a  feeling  and  when  it  comes  down  to  it,  my  "practical"  side  says  that  it    should    be  legalized,  but  still,  I  don't  like  people  doing  it...  which  is  not  the  case  with  drinking.    So  why  do  you  think  that  people    shouldn't  ?[SEP]The  reason  I  don't  like  marijuana,  alcohol,  hard  drugs,  and  certain  kinds  of  prescription  medications  is  rather  simple:  I  don't  think  people  should  sacrifice  who  they  are,  in  some  cases  their  free  will  or  their  humanity.      When  someone  gives  up  their  free  will  by  becoming  a  slave  to  a  hard  drug  or  prescription  mood  and  personality  altering  chemicals  it  is  time  for  society  to  step  in  and  give  them  back  control.    Marijuana  may  be  a  petty  offender,  much  less  of  an  offender  than  alcohol,  tobacco,  meth,  cocaine..etc..,  but  it  is  still  a  means  of  giving  up  who  you  are  or  keeping  yourself  in  a  state  of  non-growth.      We,  as  human  beings,  have  a  duty  to  ourselves  to  grow,  change,  improve,  but  always  in  the  context  of  who  we  are.  Drugs  are  a  way  to  retard  this  development,  deny  who  we  are,  and  cope  with  a  world  that  rejects  us.  It  is  an  escape;  an  escape  which  noone  deserves.      I  don't  mind  people  escaping  in  other  ways:  video  games,  reading,  television,  camping..etc,  at  least  they  are  still  thinking,  at  least  their  self  is  still  intact  and  operating.      When  people  do  drugs  they  stop  being  people  and  start  being  Mr.  or  Ms.  X+meth,  or  X+Marijuana,  or  X+alcohol.  It  isn't  helpful;  it's  downright  harmful  in  the  long-run.      Governments  and  societies  are  meant  to  protect  us;  usually  from  dangers  outside.  This  danger,  this  threat  is  unique  in  its  internal,  self-inflicted  nature.      Again,  Marijuana  is  only  a  petty  offender  in  this  case;  which  is  why  I  am  not  adamant  about  its  status  as  an  illegal  narcotic.  There  are  far  worse  legal  drugs  which  I  am  much  more  concerned  with.      Does  that  help  in  explaining  my  objection  to  its  use?  I  am  still  forming  my  opinion  on  this  one  so  I  know  my  logic  is  abit  choppy  and  in  some  cases  exaggerated.[SEP]Who  left  you  in  charge  of  deciding  what  is  best  for  anyone  (this  is  not  meant  as  harsh  criticism.  It's  meant  to  be  constructive.)?  What  if  they  don't  want  control?  What  if  they  just  want  to  be  left  alone  to  decide  for  themselves?    What  duty?  to  whom?  Why  are  other  forms  of  escape  acceptable?  Why  doesn't  anyone  deserve  this  form  of  escape?  Why  is  Mr.  Halo  (video  game)  OK?    No,  it  doesn't  explain  your  objection  to  its  use.  However,  given  that  you're  still  forming  your  opinion,  I'll  up  vote  you  to  encourage  you  to  explore  my  questions  which  are  meant  to  get  you  to  put  a  sharper  point  on  your  argument.	0
I'm  not  that  concerned  with  Marijuana.  I'd  never  use  it,  and  I  don't  let  my  boyfriend  either.  I  think  it  is  a  cop-out  and  a  rather  stupid  thing  to  get  into.      I  don't  mind  it  being  legalized,  though  I'd  rather  it  not.  I'd  even  go  so  far  as  to  say  alcohol  shouldn't  be  legal  either.      I  don't,  however,  like  the  way  these  things  are  prosecuted.  I'd  rather  see  users  treated  like  those  in  need  of  medical  and  psychological  attention.  There  shouldn't  be  anything  on  their  permanent  records,  they  shouldn't  go  to  jail  or  prison,  and  they  shouldn't  be  stigmatized.      Users  should  be  sent  through  rehabilitative  structures  and  helped  to  find  better  ways  to  spend  their  time  and  money.  Educating  themselves,  expanding  their  minds,  getting  good  jobs,  having  fun  in  more  productive  ways.  Users  should  be  helped  towards  a  better,  happier  life  without  the  need  for  mind  altering  chemicals.      Pushers,  however,  are  a  different  matter.  Small-timer  pusher  and  pushers  of  less  dangerous  drugs  should  go  through  the  same  services.  But  people  selling  deadly,  horribly  destructive  drugs  to  people  are  partially  responsible  for  their  downward  spiral.  They  should  be  punished,  with  jail  time  and  prison  time  (depending  on  what  they  did  and  how  they  did  it)  followed  by  rehabilitation  and  job  training/higher  education.[SEP]You  cannot  say  that  because  you'd  rather  not,  it  shouldn't  be  legalized.

Noone  left  me  in  charge,  I  have  an  opinion.  We  are  all  imposing  our  beliefs  about  what  is  best  for  ourselves  and  each  other  when  engaging  in  democratic  activity  so  I  don't  see  the  problem  with  my  objections  to  and  sanctions  of  narcotics.      The  difference  between  escaping  through  activity  and  escaping  through  chemical  alteration  is  the  difference  between  exercise  and  steroid  injections.  It  is  the  difference  between  increasing  your  height  through  a  proper  diet  while  still  in  your  development  stages  and  breaking  your  legs  and  resetting  them  repeatedly.      Not  only  is  the  activity  unnecessary,  a  cop-out,  and  usually  not  even  a  remedy  for  a  real  malady,  but  it  is  an  extreme  approach  and  ultimately  detrimental  to  the  person's  body,  mind,  and  their  professional  life.      What  I  am  saying  is  that  in  the  case  of  drugs  people  are  willfully  giving  up  their  freedoms;  I  would  like  to  have  it  given  back.  Besides,  if  they  are  already  giving  up  their  freedom  and  humanity  for  a  little  pleasure,  why  on  earth  should  they  have  the  rights  in  the  first  place?  Would  you  give  a  teenager  a  car  if  they  decided  to  wreck  it,  on  purpose,  every  time  just  to  experience  the  thrill?      People  shouldn't  be  allowed  to  choose  to  be  slaves  just  as  much  as  people  aren't  allowed  to  be  slave-owners.  I  find  it  frightening  that  people  seem  to  actively  look  to  be  controlled,  by  addiction  or  dictators,  and  I  don't  want  such  behavior  to  go  unchecked.      Video  games  are  an  absence  of  the  use  of  freedom,  chemical  alterations  remove  them  or  block  them.  Chemicals  destroy  personality  and  individuality,  pass-times  merely  divert  them  and  slow  their  growth  or  actualization.      Again,  Marijuana  isn't  a  big  deal  in  this  respect;  but  legalizing  it  certainly  doesn't  help.  It  does  dull  the  senses,  it  does  have  long-term  psychological  and  intellectual  effects,  and  it  is  possibly  as  if  not  more  carcinogenic  than  Tobacco  and  just  as  addictive  (not  yet  completely  substantiated  so  I  could  be  wrong).    Some  basic  facts  on  it  can  be  found  here;  a  rather  well-rounded  survey  of  Marijuana  and  its  effects:      http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/  marijuana.html        From  the  site:    "Long-term  marijuana  abuse  can  lead  to  addiction;  that  is,  compulsive  drug  seeking  and  abuse  despite  its  known  harmful  effects  upon  social  functioning  in  the  context  of  family,  school,  work,  and  recreational  activities.  Long-term  marijuana  abusers  trying  to  quit  report  irritability,  sleeplessness,  decreased  appetite,  anxiety,  and  drug  craving,  all  of  which  make  it  difficult  to  quit."    "A  number  of  studies  have  shown  an  association  between  chronic  marijuana  use  and  increased  rates  of  anxiety,  depression,  suicidal  ideation,  and  schizophrenia."    Now,  that,  again,  is  not  known  to  be  100%  true.  Marijuana  research  is  still  in  its  developing  stages  (probably  due  to  its  illegality)  and  so  not  enough  is  known  to  say  anything  with  certainty.      I'd  like  to  see  more  studies  to  make  sure  that  it  is  as  benign  as  many  people  like  to  think  it  is.  If  it  turns  out  to  be  then  I  have  even  less  of  a  problem  with  it.  The  hard  drugs,  however,  should  always  be  illegal  in  my  eyes.	1

I'm  not  that  concerned  with  Marijuana.  I'd  never  use  it,  and  I  don't  let  my  boyfriend  either.  I  think  it  is  a  cop-out  and  a  rather  stupid  thing  to  get  into.      I  don't  mind  it  being  legalized,  though  I'd  rather  it  not.  I'd  even  go  so  far  as  to  say  alcohol  shouldn't  be  legal  either.      I  don't,  however,  like  the  way  these  things  are  prosecuted.  I'd  rather  see  users  treated  like  those  in  need  of  medical  and  psychological  attention.  There  shouldn't  be  anything  on  their  permanent  records,  they  shouldn't  go  to  jail  or  prison,  and  they  shouldn't  be  stigmatized.      Users  should  be  sent  through  rehabilitative  structures  and  helped  to  find  better  ways  to  spend  their  time  and  money.  Educating  themselves,  expanding  their  minds,  getting  good  jobs,  having  fun  in  more  productive  ways.  Users  should  be  helped  towards  a  better,  happier  life  without  the  need  for  mind  altering  chemicals.      Pushers,  however,  are  a  different  matter.  Small-timer  pusher  and  pushers  of  less  dangerous  drugs  should  go  through  the  same  services.  But  people  selling  deadly,  horribly  destructive  drugs  to  people  are  partially  responsible  for  their  downward  spiral.  They  should  be  punished,  with  jail  time  and  prison  time  (depending  on  what  they  did  and  how  they  did  it)  followed  by  rehabilitation  and  job  training/higher  education.[SEP]well  i  do  see  how  you  could  perceive  cannabis  use  as  a  "cop-out"  or  a  way  to  escape  life,  but  with  me  it  only  motivates  me  to  go  to  work,  in  high  school  it  made  study  more,  and  generally  just  gives  me  that  drive  to  enjoy  life.  How  can  this  be  bad,  honestly...  the  only  derogatory  thing  it  does  to  me  is  a  bit  of  coughing,  proven  time  and  time  again  to  be  less  harmful  than  any  form  of  smoking  tobacco(pipes,  cigarettes,  cigars,  etc.).  You  said  yourself  you've  never  tried  it,  this  may  be  a  bit  blunt  for  you...but  how  can  you  make  any  judgment  on  the  subject  without  any  experience  in  it  whatsoever?!?	0
Drugs  are  really  really  really  reallly  really  really  really  BAD.	1
As  the  dutch  example  shows,  legalizing  marijuana  doesn't  come  with  any  significant  negative  effects  to  society.  Instead,  the  government  has  an  additional  source  of  income  from  taxes  and  saves  significant  amounts  of  money  that  is  currently  being  spent  on  arresting,  prosecution  and  locking  up  non  violent  marijuana  users.[SEP]I  totally  agree.  In  addition  to  this  argument,  marijuana  should  be  legal  for  many  reasons.  It  would  be  financially  beneficial  for  farmers  to  grow  marijuana  in  their  fields  in  the  U.S.  Instead  of  relying  on  prescription  drugs,  marijuana  helps  with  medical  conditions  concerning:  Glaucoma,  arthritis,  cancer,  pain,  nausea,  AIDS,  Multiple  Sclerosis,  Brain  Injury/Stroke,  Anti-Tumor  Effects,  Asthma,  Epilepsy,  Schizophrenia,  Migraine,  and  eating  disorders.  It  also  helps  with  increased  intelligence  and  focused  attention.  Marijuana  should  have  been  legalized  when  alcohol  was  legalized.	0
Drugs  are  really  really  really  reallly  really  really  really  BAD.[SEP]So  is  smoking  tabaco  and  drinking  alcohol.      and  those  are  legal...    so,  why  not  marijuana?	0
No.......  this  is  going  to  increase  the  level  of  teenagers  smoking....	1
Although  I  consider  myself  liberal,  this  is  one  issue  that  I  strongly  oppose!  Marijuana,  like  tobacco,  causes  cancer  as  it  contains  carcinogens.  Marijuana  is  also  highly  addictive.  The  tetrahydrocannabinol  in  it  is  what  causes  the  addiction  which  make  people  crave  it.  Studies  have  also  shown  that  uses  of  marijuana  usually  lead  to  more  dangerous  drugs  such  as  meth  and  cocaine.  If  you  believe  that  marijuana  does  not  kill  people,  try  telling  that  to  the  relatives  of  the  30,000  people  in  Mexico  that  died  due  to  drug  violence.  Yes,  marijuana  is  not  the  only  drug  that  cartels  produce  and  sell,  but  it  is  one  of  them.  The  only  form  it  should  be  legal  in  is  a  medical  form  but  should  be  used  with  intense  care.	1

In  the  quest  to  investigate  the  link  between  cancer  and  marijuana,  research  can  be  roughly  divided  into  two  categories:  lab  research  and  investigation  of  long  term  users  outside  of  the  lab.  Yes,  as  an  unfortunate  amount  of  lab  animal  deaths  can  attest,  cannabis  does  contain  carcinogenic  molecules.  However,  research  involving  actual  users  paints  a  rather  different  picture.        http://scienceblog.com/10660/  study-finds-no-link-between-marijuana-  use-and-lung-cancer/          http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/  story/2012-01-10/  Marijuana-doesnt-harm-lung-function-  study-says/52483604/1        There  is  some  controversy  regarding  the  efficacy  of  these  findings.  Because  marijuana  is  illegal,  it  is  difficult  to  find  users  to  participate  in  these  studies,  particularly  finding  heavy  long-term  users.  It  has  been  argued  that  if  it  were  legalized,  it  would  be  much  easier  to  find  participants  from  a  wider  range  of  the  population,  and  the  information  gathered  could  prove  to  be  more  accurate.  Still,  working  with  what  we've  got,  it  appears  that  marijuana  use  not  only  does  not  have  anywhere  near  the  effect  that  cigarette  smoking  does  in  terms  of  carcinogenic  properties,  it  even  seems  to  lower  rates  of  certain  types  of  cancer.        Marijuana  is  also  highly  addictive.      Not    highly  .  It  is  significantly  less  addicting  than  tobacco  or  alcohol,  about  on  the  same  level  as  caffeine,  but  usually  with  less  severe  withdrawal  symptoms.  Pretty  much  anything  that  stimulates  the  reward  centers  of  the  brain  will  have  some  addictive  qualities  among  a  large  enough  sampling  of  users.  But  marijuana  is  very  low  on  the  totem  pole  compared  to  many  legal  and  even  non-regulated  substances.        http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/  the-teenage-mind/201012/  is-marijuana-addictive          http://health.ezinemark.com/  the-addictiveness-of-marijuana-or-  cannabis-31e84cc7129.html          Studies  have  also  shown  that  uses  of  marijuana  usually  lead  to  more  dangerous  drugs  such  as  meth  and  cocaine.        Studies  have  also  shown  that  most  marijuana  users  drank  alcohol  before  smoking  pot.  But  alcohol  is  not  considered  a  gateway  drug.  Why?  Lower  incidence  of  illegal  drug  use.  But  lets  think  about  this  for  a  second.  As  long  as  marijuana  is  illegal  the  people  who  use  it  can  be  classified  as  "people  who  are  willing  to  break  at  least  one  law."  Among  adults,  alcohol  drinkers  aren't  classified  that  way.  Some  might  be  willing  to,  and  those  who  are  may  end  up  using  illegal  drugs.  Others  will  be  totally  law  abiding,  and  since  that  is  the  majority  of  them,  alcohol  does  not  get  considered  a  gateway  drug.  The  only  way  to  fairly  compare  the  two  would  be  to  put  them  on  the  same  legal  standing  and  do  studies  at  that  point.  Further,  people  who  buy  marijuana  illegally  have  a  greater  exposure  to  other  illegal  drugs  than  those  who  don't  since  many  dealers  deal  in  multiple  drugs.  I  suspect  that  the  legal  status  of  marijuana  plays  more  of  a  role  in  its  status  as  a  gateway  drug  than  any  actual  medical  reason.        If  you  believe  that  marijuana  does  not  kill  people,  try  telling  that  to  the  relatives  of  the  30,000  people  in  Mexico  that  died  due  to  drug  violence.        The  War  On  Drugs  is  at  least  partially  to  blame  here.  First,  the  strategy  behind  the  WOD  is  to  increase  the  cost.  But  since  most  drugs,  marijuana  included,  are  highly  elastic  commodities,  this  doesn't  much  reduce  the  demand.  Instead  it  makes  for  wealthier  drug  lords,  and  competition  between  them  leads  to  violence.  The  harder  we  crack  down,  the  worse  the  situation  gets.  Also,  we  would  make  it  less  profitable  for  the  drug  lords  by  opening  a  legal  channel  of  distribution  and  cultivation.  Having  marijuana  as  a  legitimate  source  of  retail  would  seriously  reduce  the  number  of  people  obtaining  it  illegally.  It  could  also  be  regulated  for  quality  and  purity  this  way,  which  is  currently  not  possible.	0
I've  already  argued  in  favor  of  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  but  there's  one  thing  I  forgot  about.  I  watched  "Severance"  the  other  day,  it's  about  a  group  of  a  European  sales  division  of  Palisade  Defense  are  on  a  bus  to  a  team-building  weekend  at  a  "luxury  lodge"  in  the  Mátra  Mountains  of  Hungary.  The  team-building  activities  don't  really  work  out  till  the  they  realize  some  wacko  soviet  soldiers  are  waiting  in  the  woods  to  kill  them  one  by  one,  only  then  they  manage  to  form  some  sort  of  a  group  working  together,  helping  each  other,  the  survival  of  each  is  dependent  on  the  survival  of  the  team.    I  figured  that  it  might  be  a  bit  loose,  but  there  is  something  about  getting  into  drugs  that  brings  back  something  that  was  lost  during  the  arms  race  in  the  name  of  nape  security.  To  illustrate  -  A  few  years  ago  I  wrote  a  story  about  an  alien  civilization  acting  as  if  they  were  about  to  exterminate  all  humans,  the  aliens  announced  it  on  the  news  so  a  global  panic  was  achieved,  and  nothing  really  happened,  only  that  a  feeling  of  survivalism  boiled  up  everywhere,  there  was  a  greater  power  threatening  from  above,  one  intention  over  everyone,  seeing  all  human  kind  as  unified,  ignoring  our  differences  and  difficulties  with  each  other.    Later  they  said  that  the  whole  trick  was  to  teach  humanity  a  lesson  about  individualistic  racing.	1

Although  some  people  may  say  the  marijuana  gives  you  a  "great  time"  and  "picks  you  up  off  of  your  feet"  when  you  are  feeling  glum,  legalize  it  and  we  will  have  the  same  problem  that  we  are  currently  having  with  alcohol!

Although  it  is  true  that  being  high  is  kind  of  similar  to  being  drunk  there  are  some  significant  differences;  marijuana  makes  things  feel,  for  lack  of  a  better  term,  sillier.  Alcohol  on  the  other  hand,  when  used  in  excess  can  lead  to  blacking  out,  vomiting  and  not  remembering  what  happened.  In  this  way  alcohol  is  significantly  more  dangerous.  Whereas  you  can  die  from  alcohol  intoxication,  too  much  marijuana  really  can't  hurt  you.  Also,  most  of  the  negative  feelings  associated  with  alcohol,  such  as  guilt  and  regret,  are  typically  not  experienced  when  using  marijuana.  We  have  also  seen  what  happens  when  you  make  alcohol  illegal:  organized  crime  grew  significantly  in  major  cities  because  they  were  able  to  make  an  absurd  amount  of  money  selling  bootleg  liquor.  Comparing  alcohol  to  marijuana  in  this  context  would  be  accurate.  The  selling  of  marijuana  by  gangs  is  very  profitable.  You  say  that  we  should  go  down  to  Mexico  to  smoke  but  I  live  in  Delaware  and  if  I  want  to  smoke  with  my  friends  going  to  Mexico  for  a  weekend  isn't  a  viable  option.  Instead  I  would  have  to  find  a  drug  dealer.  This  puts  money  in  the  hands  of  bad  people.  Legalization  would  put  a  stop  to  this.      Finally,  for  someone  who  claims  to  love  the  USA  so  much  you  seem  to  be  okay  with  suppressing  freedoms.  The  reason  Mexico  is  different  from  the  US  is  because  they  are  relatively  poor,  their  government  is  corrupt,  and  crime  is  rampant.  Keeping  marijuana  illegal  only  helps  criminals,  so  if  you  want  the  US  to  not  be  like  Mexico  then  you  should  encourage  the  legalization  of  marijuana.	0

i  actually  wrote  a  persuasive  essay  on  this  not  too  long  ago  for  my  English  class  and  i  got  a  perfect  score  on  it  so  i  thought  I'd  share  it  with  you  all.            The  Decision  is  Ours    Marijuana  is  a  THC  (tetrahydrocannabinol)  containing  plant  which  is  illegal  and  discriminated  against  in  all  but  a  handful  of  countries.  A  number  of  the  common  effects  of  this  plant  include  a  euphoric  feeling,  stress  reduction,  deep  thinking,  pain  relief,  increased  appetite,  and  a  few  negative  effects  such  as  lightheadedness  or  confusion.  It  has  been  argued  for  years  whether  the  cannabis  plant  is  a  drug  or  simply  a  natural  herb  like  any  other  with  stronger  side  effects,  many  people  considering  both  herb  and  drug  to  be  the  most  logical  answer.  The  earliest  it  is  recorded  to  be  utilized,  orally  and  smoked,  is  2700  B.C.  in  China  and  India,  having  been  outlawed  in  the  United  States  in  the  early  1900’s.  Uses  such  as  religious  purposes,  medicines,  and  relaxation;  should  marijuana  be  legalized?  My  belief  is  that  there  would  be  no  harm  in  this  change  of  law,  and  the  economy  would  prosper  from  it.    The  First  Amendment  stated  in  the  United  States  Constitution  Bill  of  Rights  reads:    "Congress  shall  make  no  law  respecting  an  establishment  of  religion,  or  prohibiting  the  free  exercise  thereof;  or  abridging  the  freedom  of  speech,  or  of  the  press;  or  the  right  of  the  people  peaceably  to  assemble,  and  to  petition  the  Government  for  a  redress  of  grievances."    Religious  peoples,  for  example  Rastafaris,  Shintos,  Hinus,  Buddhists,  Sufis,  Zoroastrians,  Bantus,  and  many  other  sects,  have  traditions  that  require  ganja  as  a  part  of  their  lifestyles  and  sacred  ceremonies.  All  of  these  customs  had  been  established  long  before  the  banning  of  the  plant.  So  when  prohibiting  marijuana  is  that  not  taking  away  their  first  amendment  right  of  freedom  to  exercise  their  religion?    Before  its  ban,  marijuana  was  a  major  active  ingredient  in  40-50  percent  of  medicines.  Nowadays  it  could  be  used  to  replace  at  least  10-20  percent  of  medicines.  Marijuana  has  hundreds  of  proven  uses  from  treating  nausea,  pain,  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  glaucoma,  and  asthma  to  stress  reduction  and  cancer  therapy.  If  you  have  glaucoma,  the  third  leading  cause  of  blindness  brought  about  by  increased  pressure  in  the  eyeball,  this  herbs  effects  reduce  pressure  in  the  eyeballs  and  though  other  medications  can  be  used  for  treatment  they  tend  to  lose  efficiency  over  time.  With  MS  the  normal  functioning  of  the  nerves  in  the  brain  and  spinal  cord  are  disrupted,  harsh  debilitating  attacks  that  come  and  go  along  with  many  uncomfortable  symptoms  that  lead  to  eventual  disability  occur,  the  use  of  cannabis  in  this  situation  treats  a  number  of  the  symptoms  as  well  as  delays  the  progression  of  the  disease.    In  the  United  States  alone  every  15  minutes  someone  is  killed  in  an  alcohol  related  accident,  this  is  approximately  50  percent  of  all  deadly  car  collisions.  Just  about  half  of  industrial  deaths  and  injuries  can  be  linked  to  alcohol  consumption.  Along  with  those  statistics  four  in  ten  criminals  and  three  in  four  of  domestic  violence  offenders  have  reported  to  have  alcohol  as  the  reason  for  their  violent  behavior.  On  an  annual  basis  in  the  US  alcohol  kills  about  80,000  people,  as  for  marijuana  -  there  has  never  been  a  recorded  death  due  to  marijuana,  you  are  more  likely  to  die  from  an  overdose  of  asprin.  In  fact,  as  far  as  we  know  it  is  impossible  to  overdose  on  marijuana  and  contrary  to  the  common  belief  it  does  not  influence  violence  or  crimes.  Even  all  of  the  illegal  drugs  put  together  are  responsible  for  a  small  percentage  of  deaths  compared  to  tobacco,  is  it  really  fair  that  these  more  harmful  and  fatal  substances  are  legal  but  marijuana  is  not?    During  the  rise  of  the  Rastafaris  in  Jamaica  a  man  named  Leonard  Howell  owned  a  large  amount  of  land  he  called  Pinnacle.  Pinnacle  was  designed  as  a  place  for  Leonard  and  hundreds  of  his  Ras  Tafari  followers  to  live  separated  from  the  accusing  eyes  of  the  public  who  viewed  them  as  criminals  and  thought  their  ideologies  to  be  absurd,  most  of  his  followers  had  been  poor  peasants  but  this  all  changed  with  the  growth  of  their  ganja  plantation.  They  had  grown  and  sold  so  much  marijuana  that  they  built  shops  and  were  able  to  care  for  themselves  with  plenty  of  extra  money,  the  rest  of  the  valley  eventually  depending  on  them  for  necessities  such  as  food  and  the  herb.  In  California  marijuana  is  already  the  largest  cash  crop  and  the  UN  has  estimated  that  2.5  percent  of  the  world’s  population  smokes  cannabis,  with  cannabis  legal  and  the  government  regulating  it  like  every  other  product  of  America  our  economy  would  thrive.    To  put  it  simply,  the  United  States  does  not  outlaw  “junk”  food  and  vending  machines  simply  because  it  is  bad  for  you,  although  they  may  be  unhealthy  it  is  the  individuals  choice  on  whether  they  want  to  consume  them  or  not.  It  is  the  same  with  marijuana,  though  there  are  few  minor  health  risks,  it  is  the  individuals’  responsibility  to  look  at  the  pros  and  cons  and  make  the  decision  they  want.  Should  marijuana  be  legalized?  My  answer  is  yes,  whether  for  religious  uses,  medical  reasons,  just  recreational  purposes,  or  merely  because  the  government  should  not  have  the  right  to  dictate  the  lives  of  their  citizens  if  it  is  not  harming  society,  the  legalization  of  marijuana  would  produce  no  destruction  to  our  social  order  and  the  economy  would  expand.    There  are  other  reasons  I  think  marijuana  should  be  legalized,  these  are  just  the  main  ones.  Hope  you  all  enjoyed  it  =)	0
Although  some  people  may  say  the  marijuana  gives  you  a  "great  time"  and  "picks  you  up  off  of  your  feet"  when  you  are  feeling  glum,  legalize  it  and  we  will  have  the  same  problem  that  we  are  currently  having  with  alcohol!      Alcohol  is  legal  in  the  U.S.  for  those  who  are  over  the  age  of  21,  but  then  again,  even  those  who  are  proclaimed  "mature"  enough  to  handle  drinking  still  abuse  that  privilage!  The  same  will  be  if  we  legalize  marijuana!  And  for  all  those  hippies  who  think  that  we  should  make  it  legal  I  have  one  thing  to  say  to  you:  "GO  DOWN  TO  MEXICO!  I  MEAN,  MARIJUANA  IS  PRACTICALLY  LEGAL  DOWN  THERE  AND  ITS  WORKING  OUT  JUST  FINE!  ¡Aquí  venimos  THIRD  WORLD  COUNTRY!"  So  go  FUCK  yourselves  hippies!  I  don't  know  about  the  rest  of  you,  but  I  do  NOT  want  to  live  in  a  country  like  Mexico!  That's  why  I  live  in  the  USA  baby![SEP]I  have  to  disagree  with  your  comparison  of  marijuana  to  alcohol  in  some  respects.  Although  it  is  true  that  being  high  is  kind  of  similar  to  being  drunk  there  are  some  significant  differences;  marijuana  makes  things  feel,  for  lack  of  a  better  term,  sillier.  Alcohol  on  the  other  hand,  when  used  in  excess  can  lead  to  blacking  out,  vomiting  and  not  remembering  what  happened.  In  this  way  alcohol  is  significantly  more  dangerous.  Whereas  you  can  die  from  alcohol  intoxication,  too  much  marijuana  really  can't  hurt  you.  Also,  most  of  the  negative  feelings  associated  with  alcohol,  such  as  guilt  and  regret,  are  typically  not  experienced  when  using  marijuana.  We  have  also  seen  what  happens  when  you  make  alcohol  illegal:  organized  crime  grew  significantly  in  major  cities  because  they  were  able  to  make  an  absurd  amount  of  money  selling  bootleg  liquor.  Comparing  alcohol  to  marijuana  in  this  context  would  be  accurate.  The  selling  of  marijuana  by  gangs  is  very  profitable.  You  say  that  we  should  go  down  to  Mexico  to  smoke  but  I  live  in  Delaware  and  if  I  want  to  smoke  with  my  friends  going  to  Mexico  for  a  weekend  isn't  a  viable  option.  Instead  I  would  have  to  find  a  drug  dealer.  This  puts  money  in  the  hands  of  bad  people.  Legalization  would  put  a  stop  to  this.      Finally,  for  someone  who  claims  to  love  the  USA  so  much  you  seem  to  be  okay  with  suppressing  freedoms.  The  reason  Mexico  is  different  from  the  US  is  because  they  are  relatively  poor,  their  government  is  corrupt,  and  crime  is  rampant.  Keeping  marijuana  illegal  only  helps  criminals,  so  if  you  want  the  US  to  not  be  like  Mexico  then  you  should  encourage  the  legalization  of  marijuana.[SEP]What  about  paranoia?  This  is  a  negative  feeling  caused  by  marijuana....  wait  a  minute....  it's  a  negative  feeling  because  it  is  illegal.  If  it  were  legal,  then  you  wouldn't  be  paranoid.  Hang  on,  I  think  I  heard  the  police  at  my  door....  nope,  must  have  been  the  wind.  Anyway...  what  was  I  saying?  Oh  yeah,  marijuana  is  harmful  to  your  memory,  that's  a  negative  feeling  /  side  effect.  Does  this  make  any  sense?[SEP]I've  seen  you  post  on  a  lot  of  debates,  and  as  funny  as  your  jokes  are  (/sarcasm),  I  have  to  disagree  with  your  point.  Although  people  may  not  be  able  to  remember  things  as  well  while  high,  I  do  not  believe  there  has  been  any  study  done  to  see  if  there  is  actually  a  correlation  between  marijuana  use  and  memory  loss.  If  I  am  wrong  then  please  post  the  study.  (Also  do  you  think  that  a  little  memory  loss  warrants  prohibition?)	0

What  I  find  hard  to  believe  is  that  this  question  pops  up  all  of  the  time  on  the  internet...  and  nothing  changes...    In  debates,  if  you  say  one  thing  in  opposition  to  it's  legalization  you  are  immediately  discriminated  against  and  ignored  for  the  valid  points  that  you  may  have,  and  then  the  people  advocating  it's  use  have  nothing  more  to  show  in  their  argument  than  what  you  have,  but  sensationalized,  and  even  though  they  don't  have  credible  evidence  (ok,  so  one  does),  they  call  you  out  for  not  having  evidence,  and  like  children,  hop  around  proclaiming  your  stupidity...    Arguing  this  topic  online  is  useless,  and  I  have  always  thought  that.  You  are  all  like  Gollum  with  the  ring  of  soromon...  there's  no  point.      BTW,  if  you  are  so  right,  do  something  about  it  already  so  that  I  don't  have  to  hear  about  it  anymore.	1

Face  it,  the  real  reason  pot  is  illegal  is  so  1)  cops  have  increased  ability  to  harass  minorities  and  lower  class  people,  and  2)  profits  from  alcohol  and  pharmacy  are  artifically  protected.  These  reasons  do  not  justify  the  loss  of  freedom  of  millions  of  Americans.      1  out  of  3  Americans  have  tried  marijuana  (and  that's  just  those  who  will  admit  it.)

Now  if  you  think  its  mindless  self  indulgence  to  want  freedom  than  you  must  be  a  fascist  or  a  communist  or  maybe  just  confused  and  controlled;  regardless  I  pity  you.[SEP]What  is  truly  pitiful  is  that  one  could  find  pity  and  fear  in  what  you  do  not  know.  I  use  your  post  as  supporting  evidence.        Now,  if  you're  realistically  thinking  about  this  issue,  and  not  in  Imagination  Land,  you  would  respect  my  point  of  view  as  a  faction  of  the  democratic  comity.  I  am  a  citizen  of  these  United  States  of  America,  and  I  know  what  that  means.      I  personally  have  no  concern  about  the  drug  itself  and  I  am  fully  aware  that  cigarettes  and  alcohol  are  more  dangerous,  but  legal.      When  I  say  that  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  what  I  mean  is  for  recreational  use.  Medicinal  use  is  fine  for  the  few  drugs  on  the  market  that  marijuana  could  (realistically)  replace.  Also,  I  actually  advocate  the  use  of  hemp  and  wish  America  would  get  with  the  program,  I  know  the  benefits  of  hemp  cloths  and  hemp  oils.      What  I  don't  like  about  weed,  is  what  it  does  to  people,  and  I  am  sure  this  is  the  reason  it  has  been  made  illegal  and  mainly,  why  it  has  stayed  illegal.  I  have  seen  the  original  arguments  against  it's  recreational  use,  and  I  think  that  is  absurd,  it  doesn't  make  you  crazy,  it  doesn't  make  you  blood  thirsty,  etc.        If  you  look  at  society  as  a  whole,  we  already  have  a  few  cancers  at  work.  Alcohol  use,  which  with  it  brings  tons  of  social  deviance  because  it's  a  mind  altering  drug.  Cigarettes,  for  the  economy  are  bad,  because  those  who  smoke  are  hopelessly  addicted  and  will  spend  money  on  cigarettes  before  spending  it  on  things  that  they  should  buy,  like  food  or  clothes.  Do  we  really,  at  this  point  need  another?  For  people  who  don't  drink,  and  for  people  who  don't  smoke  cigarettes?      Like  I  said,  think  about  it  realistically.  What  is  government  for?  Why  is  a  government  needed  at  all,  I  mean,  what  is  the  main  single  duty  of  a  government???    It  is  to  secure  domestic  peace  ,  before  anything  else,  that  is  what  a  government  does.  The  people  within  the  government  agree  to  be  controlled  for  peace.  If  someone  steps  out  of  line,  because  they  have  agreed  to  live  under  this  government,  are  held  to  the  same  rules  as  the  next.  No  one  steps  out  of  line,  and  we  have  a  perfectly  paired  society  to  it's  government.  Unfortunately  we,  as  humans,  cannot  have  this.        So  if  the  government  only  really  exists  to  secure  domestic  peace,  yet  we  already  have  a  number  of  drugs  out  there,  why  should  we  have  another  to  complicate  things  with.        Also,  you  have  to  imagine  that  weed  is  legal.  No  more  will  people  feel  the  need  to  be  home  when  stoned.  They  might  as  well  get  stoned  in  public.  Like  drinking,  especially  if  it  were  made  illegal,  people  would  take  their  beer  home  with  them,  and  drink  there,  most  people    do  ,  stay  home  and  drink.  If  it  were  illegal,  you  wouldn't  see  drunk  people  as  much  now  would  you?  I  highly  doubt  you  would.        Marijuana,  I  logically  think,  would  be  more  addicting  than  tobacco  and  alcohol  combined  if  it  were  made  legal  and  then  integrated  into  popular  culture,  as  tobacco  is.  You  get  more  for  less,  with  less  consequences...  what  a  dream,  right?  I  mean,  if  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization,  yet  I  would  still  do  it  if  it  were,  doesn't  that  mean  something???      It's  something  that  I  don't  want  to  deal  with,  and  I  think  a  lot  of  people  would  agree  with  me  on  this.  If  it  were  legalized,  it  would  only  get  worse.        That's  really  all  I  can  say  for  now,  and  sorry  if  it  wasn't  enough  to  satisfy  your  lack  of  understanding.        I  would  like  to  advise  you  that  ad  hominen  arguments  are  not  welcome  here.            You  are  on  a  website  that  allows  you  to  share  ideas  and  opinions.  Do  not  attack  people  for  their  opinions  because,  if  you  think  that  denying  the  legalization  of  marijuana  is  not  American,  you  are  doing  the  greater  evil  by  suppressing  the  voices  of  the  citizens  that  this  democracy  represents  by  using  childish  and  petty  insults.	1
I  don't  think  the  legalization  of  marijuana  would  be  a  good  idea.      Why  does  everyone  push  so  hard  for  it,  when  all  it  does  is  make  you  high???    Talk  about  mindless  self  indulgence...  I  hate  people  who  have  problems  dealing  with  the  fact  that  they  cannot  always  have  what  they    want  .[SEP]That  point  of  view  is  very  scary.  You  think  the  government  should  be  able  to  control  your  personal  life  even  when  your  minding  your  own  business  and  hurting  no  one.  And  yet  also  allow  big  corporations  to  push  substances  more  deadly  than  marijuana  on  consumers  (Alcohol,  Tobacco,  Prescription  Drugs).      Legalization  is  about  the  fact  that  a  person  should  have  the  right  to  privacy  and  the  choice  to  live  their  lives  how  they  see  fit  as  long  as  they  hurt  no  one  else.  Consider  the  fact  that  prescription  drugs  have  become  the  number  one  killer  in  these  recent  years.  People  are  going  to  get  high  off  what  is  available;  why  restrict  them  to  things  that  are  more  dangerous.  And  why  criminalize  people  who  choose  to  use  natural  herbs  instead  of  stuff  created  in  laboratories.    Last  I  checked  America  was  a  country  of  liberty  and  freedom;  but  I  guess  that  doesn't  mean  the  same  thing  in  this  last  century.  The  founding  fathers  didn't  want  to  have  some  central  government  dictating  the  citizen's  daily  lives.  It  is  supposed  to  be  a  government  by  the  people  and  for  the  people.  And  most  importantly  under  the  law  of  the  constitution.  People  don't  want  anything  they  don't  deserve;  they  only  want  the  one  thing  supposedly  guaranteed  in  this  country;  Freedom.

There  are  few  ill  effects,  even  among  the  heaviest  long-term  smokers.  But  heavy,  long-term  repetition  of  most  activities  will  have  negative  results  (running,  for  example).    You  also  appear  to  be  claiming  that  marijuana  use  is  somehow  a  threat  to  domestic  peace.  You  also  seem  to  think  it  will  magically  develop  addictive  properties  once  its  legal.    You  fail  to  show  why  the  law  should  be  invasive  enough  to  regulate  what  you  put  in  your  own  body,  or  why  the  law  should  be  used  to  legislate  away  things  you  don't  like.  Governments  allow  industry  to  put  all  kinds  of  toxins  and  waste  into  our  food,  air,  and  water,  and  the  government  gets  paid  to  allow  it,  and  all  the  citizens  are  forced  to  ingest  it.  No  reason  we  shouldn't  all  have  the  right  to  knowingly  poison  ourselves.    Also,  your  argument  seems  to  assume  that  many  people  would  suddenly  begin  using  marijuana  who  are  not  already,  and  there's  no  data  to  prove  this.  People  are  already  spending  their  pot  budgets,  nothing  would  change  there  (except  maybe  they  could  grow  it  and  save).    Your  entire  view  of  government  is  rather  disturbing.  "The  people  within  the  government  agree  to  be  controlled  for  peace."  Citizen-control  is    not    a  constitutional  principle,  in  fact  our  rights  insulate  us  from  overt  control  by  the  government.	0

If  not  I  shouldn't  be  here.      Fail  to  show  why  law  should  regulate  what  you  put  in  your  body:    They  already  do,    F.D.A.  ,  that's  reason  enough.  If  that's  not  good  enough  for  you,  talk  to  a  lawyer.        Fail  to  prove  that  when  more  people  use  marijuana,  and  it's  accepted,  that  there  will  be  more  people  addicted:    Take  statistics  and  logic.      My  view  of  government  is  disturbing  .  Fine  then,  I'll  prescribe  you  your  natural  anti-depressant  that  helps  deal  with  this  ugly  fact  of  life.      My  main  issue  with  this  whole  argument  is  that  I  cannot  believe  that    THIS    topic,  of  all  things,  is  the  one  that  people  get  pissed  off  about...      One  could  strip  us  of  every  liberty  imagined  by  our  forefathers,  and  all  we  would  do  is  sit  and  complain  about  our  damned  marijuana...  THAT  IS  SICKENING!!!  Not    my    view  of  government!!!!  THE  FACT  THAT  I  HEAR  ABOUT  MARIJUANA  100  TIMES  A  DAY  INSTEAD  OF  WTF  WE'RE  GOING  TO  DO  ABOUT  IMMIGRATION  REFORM  OR  NAFTA  OR  WHATEVER  THE  HELL  IS  GOING  ON  IN  THE  WHITE  HOUSE  AND  IRAN  AND  WHY  SOME  CERTAIN  STATES  ARE  SEGREGATING  SEXUALITY  AND  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH....      No,  all  you  can  stand  to  do  anything  about  is  try  to  get  your  weed  back.  Maybe  that's  reason  enough  not  to  legalize  it...  Think  about  all  of  the  people  wasting  their  time  trying  to  legalize  it...  then  imagine  them  wasting  x20  the  amount  of  time  being  stoned  all  the  time  talking  about  how  they  finally  got  what  they  wanted...	1
I  don't  think  the  legalization  of  marijuana  would  be  a  good  idea.      Why  does  everyone  push  so  hard  for  it,  when  all  it  does  is  make  you  high???    Talk  about  mindless  self  indulgence...  I  hate  people  who  have  problems  dealing  with  the  fact  that  they  cannot  always  have  what  they    want  .[SEP]That  point  of  view  is  very  scary.  You  think  the  government  should  be  able  to  control  your  personal  life  even  when  your  minding  your  own  business  and  hurting  no  one.  And  yet  also  allow  big  corporations  to  push  substances  more  deadly  than  marijuana  on  consumers  (Alcohol,  Tobacco,  Prescription  Drugs).      Legalization  is  about  the  fact  that  a  person  should  have  the  right  to  privacy  and  the  choice  to  live  their  lives  how  they  see  fit  as  long  as  they  hurt  no  one  else.  Consider  the  fact  that  prescription  drugs  have  become  the  number  one  killer  in  these  recent  years.  People  are  going  to  get  high  off  what  is  available;  why  restrict  them  to  things  that  are  more  dangerous.  And  why  criminalize  people  who  choose  to  use  natural  herbs  instead  of  stuff  created  in  laboratories.    Last  I  checked  America  was  a  country  of  liberty  and  freedom;  but  I  guess  that  doesn't  mean  the  same  thing  in  this  last  century.  The  founding  fathers  didn't  want  to  have  some  central  government  dictating  the  citizen's  daily  lives.  It  is  supposed  to  be  a  government  by  the  people  and  for  the  people.  And  most  importantly  under  the  law  of  the  constitution.  People  don't  want  anything  they  don't  deserve;  they  only  want  the  one  thing  supposedly  guaranteed  in  this  country;  Freedom.    Now  if  you  think  its  mindless  self  indulgence  to  want  freedom  than  you  must  be  a  fascist  or  a  communist  or  maybe  just  confused  and  controlled;  regardless  I  pity  you.[SEP]What  is  truly  pitiful  is  that  one  could  find  pity  and  fear  in  what  you  do  not  know.  I  use  your  post  as  supporting  evidence.        Now,  if  you're  realistically  thinking  about  this  issue,  and  not  in  Imagination  Land,  you  would  respect  my  point  of  view  as  a  faction  of  the  democratic  comity.  I  am  a  citizen  of  these  United  States  of  America,  and  I  know  what  that  means.      I  personally  have  no  concern  about  the  drug  itself  and  I  am  fully  aware  that  cigarettes  and  alcohol  are  more  dangerous,  but  legal.      When  I  say  that  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization  of  marijuana,  what  I  mean  is  for  recreational  use.  Medicinal  use  is  fine  for  the  few  drugs  on  the  market  that  marijuana  could  (realistically)  replace.  Also,  I  actually  advocate  the  use  of  hemp  and  wish  America  would  get  with  the  program,  I  know  the  benefits  of  hemp  cloths  and  hemp  oils.      What  I  don't  like  about  weed,  is  what  it  does  to  people,  and  I  am  sure  this  is  the  reason  it  has  been  made  illegal  and  mainly,  why  it  has  stayed  illegal.  I  have  seen  the  original  arguments  against  it's  recreational  use,  and  I  think  that  is  absurd,  it  doesn't  make  you  crazy,  it  doesn't  make  you  blood  thirsty,  etc.        If  you  look  at  society  as  a  whole,  we  already  have  a  few  cancers  at  work.  Alcohol  use,  which  with  it  brings  tons  of  social  deviance  because  it's  a  mind  altering  drug.  Cigarettes,  for  the  economy  are  bad,  because  those  who  smoke  are  hopelessly  addicted  and  will  spend  money  on  cigarettes  before  spending  it  on  things  that  they  should  buy,  like  food  or  clothes.  Do  we  really,  at  this  point  need  another?  For  people  who  don't  drink,  and  for  people  who  don't  smoke  cigarettes?      Like  I  said,  think  about  it  realistically.  What  is  government  for?  Why  is  a  government  needed  at  all,  I  mean,  what  is  the  main  single  duty  of  a  government???    It  is  to  secure  domestic  peace  ,  before  anything  else,  that  is  what  a  government  does.  The  people  within  the  government  agree  to  be  controlled  for  peace.  If  someone  steps  out  of  line,  because  they  have  agreed  to  live  under  this  government,  are  held  to  the  same  rules  as  the  next.  No  one  steps  out  of  line,  and  we  have  a  perfectly  paired  society  to  it's  government.  Unfortunately  we,  as  humans,  cannot  have  this.        So  if  the  government  only  really  exists  to  secure  domestic  peace,  yet  we  already  have  a  number  of  drugs  out  there,  why  should  we  have  another  to  complicate  things  with.        Also,  you  have  to  imagine  that  weed  is  legal.  No  more  will  people  feel  the  need  to  be  home  when  stoned.  They  might  as  well  get  stoned  in  public.  Like  drinking,  especially  if  it  were  made  illegal,  people  would  take  their  beer  home  with  them,  and  drink  there,  most  people    do  ,  stay  home  and  drink.  If  it  were  illegal,  you  wouldn't  see  drunk  people  as  much  now  would  you?  I  highly  doubt  you  would.        Marijuana,  I  logically  think,  would  be  more  addicting  than  tobacco  and  alcohol  combined  if  it  were  made  legal  and  then  integrated  into  popular  culture,  as  tobacco  is.  You  get  more  for  less,  with  less  consequences...  what  a  dream,  right?  I  mean,  if  I  am  opposed  to  the  legalization,  yet  I  would  still  do  it  if  it  were,  doesn't  that  mean  something???      It's  something  that  I  don't  want  to  deal  with,  and  I  think  a  lot  of  people  would  agree  with  me  on  this.  If  it  were  legalized,  it  would  only  get  worse.        That's  really  all  I  can  say  for  now,  and  sorry  if  it  wasn't  enough  to  satisfy  your  lack  of  understanding.        I  would  like  to  advise  you  that  ad  hominen  arguments  are  not  welcome  here.            You  are  on  a  website  that  allows  you  to  share  ideas  and  opinions.  Do  not  attack  people  for  their  opinions  because,  if  you  think  that  denying  the  legalization  of  marijuana  is  not  American,  you  are  doing  the  greater  evil  by  suppressing  the  voices  of  the  citizens  that  this  democracy  represents  by  using  childish  and  petty  insults.[SEP]You  fail  to  show  what  marijuana  supposedly  "does  to  people".  There  are  few  ill  effects,  even  among  the  heaviest  long-term  smokers.  But  heavy,  long-term  repetition  of  most  activities  will  have  negative  results  (running,  for  example).    You  also  appear  to  be  claiming  that  marijuana  use  is  somehow  a  threat  to  domestic  peace.  You  also  seem  to  think  it  will  magically  develop  addictive  properties  once  its  legal.    You  fail  to  show  why  the  law  should  be  invasive  enough  to  regulate  what  you  put  in  your  own  body,  or  why  the  law  should  be  used  to  legislate  away  things  you  don't  like.  Governments  allow  industry  to  put  all  kinds  of  toxins  and  waste  into  our  food,  air,  and  water,  and  the  government  gets  paid  to  allow  it,  and  all  the  citizens  are  forced  to  ingest  it.  No  reason  we  shouldn't  all  have  the  right  to  knowingly  poison  ourselves.    Also,  your  argument  seems  to  assume  that  many  people  would  suddenly  begin  using  marijuana  who  are  not  already,  and  there's  no  data  to  prove  this.  People  are  already  spending  their  pot  budgets,  nothing  would  change  there  (except  maybe  they  could  grow  it  and  save).    Your  entire  view  of  government  is  rather  disturbing.  "The  people  within  the  government  agree  to  be  controlled  for  peace."  Citizen-control  is    not    a  constitutional  principle,  in  fact  our  rights  insulate  us  from  overt  control  by  the  government.[SEP]Fail  to  show  what  marijuana  supposedly  "does  to  people":    If  you've  done  your  research,  you  know  what  I'm  talking  about.  If  not  I  shouldn't  be  here.      Fail  to  show  why  law  should  regulate  what  you  put  in  your  body:    They  already  do,    F.D.A.  ,  that's  reason  enough.  If  that's  not  good  enough  for  you,  talk  to  a  lawyer.        Fail  to  prove  that  when  more  people  use  marijuana,  and  it's  accepted,  that  there  will  be  more  people  addicted:    Take  statistics  and  logic.      My  view  of  government  is  disturbing  .  Fine  then,  I'll  prescribe  you  your  natural  anti-depressant  that  helps  deal  with  this  ugly  fact  of  life.      My  main  issue  with  this  whole  argument  is  that  I  cannot  believe  that    THIS    topic,  of  all  things,  is  the  one  that  people  get  pissed  off  about...      One  could  strip  us  of  every  liberty  imagined  by  our  forefathers,  and  all  we  would  do  is  sit  and  complain  about  our  damned  marijuana...  THAT  IS  SICKENING!!!  Not    my    view  of  government!!!!  THE  FACT  THAT  I  HEAR  ABOUT  MARIJUANA  100  TIMES  A  DAY  INSTEAD  OF  WTF  WE'RE  GOING  TO  DO  ABOUT  IMMIGRATION  REFORM  OR  NAFTA  OR  WHATEVER  THE  HELL  IS  GOING  ON  IN  THE  WHITE  HOUSE  AND  IRAN  AND  WHY  SOME  CERTAIN  STATES  ARE  SEGREGATING  SEXUALITY  AND  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH  BLAH....      No,  all  you  can  stand  to  do  anything  about  is  try  to  get  your  weed  back.  Maybe  that's  reason  enough  not  to  legalize  it...  Think  about  all  of  the  people  wasting  their  time  trying  to  legalize  it...  then  imagine  them  wasting  x20  the  amount  of  time  being  stoned  all  the  time  talking  about  how  they  finally  got  what  they  wanted...[SEP]While  you've  presented  some  valid  arguments,  if  this  topic  really  upsets  you  that  much,  the  best  course  of  action  on  your  part  would  probably  be  to  ignore  it.  This  would  help  your  peace  of  mind  and  would  avoid  conflict  with  those  who  vote  you  down  for  being  off  topic.    This  is  a  site  where  everybody  can  create  a  debate  about  anything,  inevitably  someone  will  create  a  debate  about  some  topic  you  really  can't  hear  about  it  anymore.  I've  encountered  some  of  those  myself.  However,  the  people  that  choose  to  participate  in  the  debate  have  every  right  to  do  so,  that's  what  this  site  has  been  created  for.  If,  instead  of  just  ignoring  those  debates,  people  would  constantly  jump  in  to  complain  about  how  they  can't  hear  about  it  anymore,  that  would  strongly  deteriorate  the  quality  of  the  debates.  Looking  at  your  first  couple  of  posts,  they  did  not  add  anything  to  the  debate,  only  later  did  you  write  a  good  argument.    Yes  there  are  more  important  topics  to  discuss,  does  that  mean  that  people  should  only  discuss  those  topics?  No,  everybody  is  free  to  discuss  what  they  feel  like.  Some  people  feel  strongly  about  this  topic  and  some  people  are  out  there  actively  campaigning  for  legalization.  If  you  count  yourself  among  those  that  have  made  up  their  mind,  and  don't  feel  like  discussing  it  anymore,  then  the  best  thing  to  do  is  probably  to  just  scroll  right  past  the  debate.    Lastly  I  would  like  to  add  that  what  I  just  said  applies  to  a  range  of  comments  on  various  debates.  I  decided  to  specifically  comment  on  your  arguments,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  you're  actually  interested  in  conducting  quality  debates.	0
I  hate  Marijuana.    But  it  should  be  legal.  Just  like  alcohol  and  tobacco  and  fast  food  etc.  (things  that  are  bad  for  you  that  I  also  don't  like,  accept  fast  food  (;  )are  legal.      Especially  when  alcohol  is  the  stuff  that  actually  makes  people  aggressive  and  ruins  families  and  can  lead  to  abuse.  If      anything    is  gunna  be  illegal,  make  it  alcohol.      And  no  I  don't  think  It  will  do  wonders  for  the  economy.	0
Actually,  I'm  not  a  stoner.  I  don't  like  the  stuff,  tried  it  once  when  I  was  18,  had  a  bad  reaction,  and  I've  never  tried  it  again.  However,  that  doesn't  stop  me  from  seeing  that  it  has  huge  economic  benefits.  Plus  I've  seen  its  benefits  on  a  friend  of  mine  who  has  scoliosis.  Muscle  relaxants  do  very  little  for  him  and  they  have  bad  side  effects,  whereas  pot  helps  him  to  function  and  leaves  him  relatively  pain  free.[SEP]Marijuana  has  huge  amounts  of  byproducts  which  can  be  valuable  to  the  community.  Its  medicinal  properties  are  well  known  and  studied.  It  would  provide  jobs  across  the  country,  provide  hemp  crops  for  textile  use,  and  would  provide  large  amounts  of  tourism  revenue  from  potheads  worldwide.    It  provides  an  extra  source  of  taxation  for  the  government  (they  can  tax  pot  as  heavily  as  they  do  with  cigarettes).      It  also  removes  a  major  gateway  to  other  more  dangerous  illegal  substances.    Pot  is  possible  to  saliva  test  roadside,  thus  providing  another  area  for  the  government  to  pull  revenue  from  (drug  driving).    It  also  frees  up  police  officers  who  are  busy  chasing  minor  users,  and  enables  them  to  go  after  more  serious  criminals.[SEP]Exactly.  Hemp  can  be  used  for  much  more  too.

That  was  over  a  decade  ago.  The  progression  was  slow.  Very  slow.  It  was  a  series  of  very  small  incremental  steps.  The  "one  step  over  the  line,  it's  hardly  anything"  lead  to  "one  more  step"  leads  to  "one  more  step",  and  before  you  know  it  the  line  is  so  far  back  that  you  can't  see  your  starting  position  any  more.      He  didn't  start  using  pot  because  he  wanted  to  be  high.  He  started  using  it  to  fit  in  with  a  crowd  of  people.  He  was  very  susceptible  to  peer  pressure.  That's  the  reason  he  went  on  to  other  drugs.  He  continued  to  use  pot  after  we  moved  to  a  different  town,  because  by  that  time  it  was  habitual.  New  place,  new  pressure  to  make  friends,  put  him  into  contact  with  dealers  who  were  selling  more  than  just  pot.  And  he  so  desperately  wanted  to  be  "friends"  with  his  dealer.  So  yes,  it  was  his  fault,  because  if  he  hadn't  been  such  a  weak  assed  spineless  wimp  of  a  man  he  would  have  stuck  by  his  guns.  But  if  he'd  been  able  to  obtain  marijuana  over  the  counter,  he  wouldn't  have  needed  that  link  to  the  dealer.[SEP]Marijuana  has  huge  amounts  of  byproducts  which  can  be  valuable  to  the  community.

I  hate  Marijuana.    But  it  should  be  legal.  Just  like  alcohol  and  tobacco  and  fast  food  etc.  (things  that  are  bad  for  you  that  I  also  don't  like,  accept  fast  food  (;  )are  legal.      Especially  when  alcohol  is  the  stuff  that  actually  makes  people  aggressive  and  ruins  families  and  can  lead  to  abuse.  If      anything    is  gunna  be  illegal,  make  it  alcohol.      And  no  I  don't  think  It  will  do  wonders  for  the  economy.[SEP]Thank  you  for  being  open  minded  Jake.  But  I  have  to  disagree  with  you  on  the  fact  that  you  think  it  will  not  do  wonders  for  the  economy.  With  the  legaliztion  of  Cannabis  would  most  certainly  come  the  legaliztion  to  grow  and  manufacture  Hemp  products.  Hemp  can  be  used  for  virutally  anything  and  the  industry  would  explode  over  night.  You  have  to  remember  that  legaliztion  would  effect  multiple  markets.	0

What's  bad  about  marijuana  is  that  you  have  to  burn  it  in  order  to  get  the  best  high.  The  burning  part  is  what  causes  health  problems  less  in  danger  than  smoking  tobacco.    Marijuana  is  totally  healthy  and  science  proved  that  the  old  crap  used  to  be  told  on  TV  and  newspaper  is  just  not  true.  It  does  not  produce  violence  (exactly  the  opposite),  it  does  not  kill  brain  cells  at  all,  and  it  does  not  make  you  insane.	0
It'll  get  my  guitarist  to  stop  complaining  about  how  much  the  government  sucks.	0
I  would  have  to  say  no!  because  to  smoke  Marijuana  you  would  have  to  light  it  then  smoke  it,  which  will  increase  your  carbon  foot  print  and  intern  cause  Global  Warming  and  kill  the  polar  bears.  large  areas  of  land  will  become  hot  and  humid  which  will  intern  become  great  farm  land  on  which  to  grow  pot...  am  i  rambling?  I'm  fucking  high....  legalize  it!	1
Unlike  tobacco  and  alcohol,  marijuana  is  a  gateway  drug.  Once  you  start  on  it,  you  want  some  more,  until  you  grow  tolerance  and  need  something  stronger.  Then  you  move  on  to  all  the  other  drugs  that  turn  people  into  zombies.  And  besides,  once  you  legalize  marijuana,  what's  next?  Will  they  legalize  all  those  other  drugs  that  make  people  into  mindless,  drug-dependent  loons?	1

Clearly  you  don't  know  anyone  who  smokes  weed  and  your  just  reciting  the  DARE  propaganda  they  told  you.  If  something  harmless  like  weed  can  lead  to  something  dangerous  like  meth,  than  drinking  milk  leads  to  vodka.  Not  everyone  who  smokes  weed  is  stupid  enough  to  try  any  other  drug.  And  you  don't  build  up  tolerance  and  NEED  something.  I  know  tons  of  people  who  smoke  everyday  and  get  better  grades  than  non  smokers,  haven't  tried  any  other  drugs,  and  are  less  zombie  like  than  someone  spouting  out  propaganda  someone  told  to  them.      And  btw,  all  my  friends  who  smoke  are  usually  A  LOT  more  interesting  than  people  who  don't.	0

Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.	0

Yes  people  do  break  the  rules,  and  if  they  do  they  will  be  punished.  We  have  laws  against  playing  music  too  loud,  but  because  people  do  it  anyway,  should  we  make  playing  music  illegal?    Yes  marijuana  would  be  cheaper  if  legalized,  you  do  not  understand  the  way  a  black  market  works.  Because  the  people  growing,  trafficking,  and  selling  marijuana  have  to  take  huge  risks,  they  make  the  price  higher.  Once  legalized  the  price  would  lower.  So  your  argument  that  there  would  be  a  blackmarket  with  cheaper  prices  is  invalid.    Really  the  last  thing  we  need  as  a  country  is  more  people  doing  marijuana?  I  can  think  of  far  worse  things.  Assuming  that  legalizing  it  would  significantly  increase  use  long  term,  which  you  don't  have  evidence  for,  what  is  the  big  deal?  People  do  not  end  up  at  rehab  for  marijuana.  It  is  not  addictive.  If  they  go  to  rehab  it  is  because  they  have  addictive  personalities  and  are  using  it  too  much  because  of  that,  not  because  it  is  addicting.  People  with  addictive  personalities  can  need  help  for  anything.  Out  of  curiosity  would  you  have  slapped  Steve  Jobs  and  Steve  Wozniak  when  they  created  apple  while  smoking  marijuana.  Very  intelligent  and  successful  people  habitually  smoke  marijuana.  Just  because  unsuccessful  gravitate  toward  toward  it,  does  not  mean  it  makes  you  unsuccessful.  As  we  say  in  statistics,  correlation  does  not  imply  causation.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	0
The  question's  not  'will  the  US  ...'  because  we  all  know  such  a  turnaround  in  policy  won't  happen  so  easily.    Also,  out  of  interest,  considering  that  that  weed  prices  would  be  determined  by  Supply/Demand,  if  demand  stays  the  same,  and  the  cost  of  supply  goes  down,  then  wouldn't  the  optimum  price  be  at  most  the  same,  or  less?  Supply/Demand  does  apply  to  dealers,  there's  way  different  costs  around  the  world,  so  I  don't  really  see  any  basis  for  the  'gunna  cost  so  much'  argument.[SEP]I  doubt  the  war  on  drugs  will  end,  but  I  believe  a  person  should  be  able  to  put  into  their  body  what  they  want.	1
Cannabis  is  not  psychologically  addictive  and  is  no  worse  than  alcohol  or  cigarettes.  With  proper  regulation  i  do  not  see  why  legalizing  weed  cannot  work.	0
Hell  to  the  yes!  If  I  want  to  use  pot,  that  is  my  business!	0
The  war  on  drugs  is  as  useless  and  money-consuming  as  the  war  on  terror,  simply  because  you  will  NEVER  eliminate  either  of  the  two.  There  will  always  be  drugs  and  there  will  always  be  terrorists.  I'm  all  for  legalizing  weed.  Not  only  would  it  be  better  for  the  economy,  but  look  at  Amsterdam  -  weed  is  legal  over  there  and  you  never  hear  anything  out  of  them.  They've  been  onto  something  for  a  long  time  now.  :)	0
Legalizing  pot  alone  would  not  end  the  war  on  drugs.  It  would  help,  but  it  would  do  very  little  to  the  biggest  of  our  problems  on  the  war,  and  that  is,  our  organized  crime.  Our  big  time  criminals,  the  Mafia's,  none  of  this  small  time  dealers  we've  got  going  on  with  pot  (and  when  I  say  small  time,  I'm  more  referring  to  the  type  of  criminal  activity  that  goes  on  with  in  these  drug  organizations),  my  personal  opinion  would  be  the  only  way  to  completely  end  the  war  on  drugs  would  be  to  legalize  everything.  This  sounds  absurd,  I  know,  but  think  of  the  lives  saved  by  doing  this.  Underground  sex  trades,  the  biggest  Mafia's  in  the  world,  petty  cold  criminals-  they're  all  run  by  drugs.  In  other  words,  its  the  law  thats  allowing  these  criminals  to  be  what  they  are.  If  there  were  no  law  against  drugs,  if  all  drugs  were  run  through  a  license,  and  sold  legally,  there  would  be  a  whole  hell  of  a  lot  less  murders,  theft,  prostitution,  spreading  of  disease,  deaths,  and  for  most,  it  would  shut  down  the  worlds  biggest  criminal  operations  which  thrive  on  selling  illegal  drugs.  I'm  aware  this  will  never,  ever  happen...  but  it's  worth  a  thought.	0
honestly  i  wish  they  would.  they  r  putting  pot  heads  in  jail  and  not  saving  any  room  for  the  people  that  actually  deserve  it.  i  dont  smoke  pot  but  i  no  people  that  do  ;)	0
Why  are  there  no  arguments,  unless  this  a  trap?  Oh  well,  the  war  on  drugs  is  a  stupid  thing,  its  basically  prohibition  again,  and  that  didn't  turn  out  well.  There  are  some  bad  drugs  out  there  but  drugs  are  a  tool.  Non-ordinary  conciousness  is  still  conciousness,  albeit  not  clarity  in  most  cases.  But  it  is  still  the  experience  to  learn  from,  I'm  not  saying  go  do  meth  and  have  an  experience,  no,  soft  drugs  and  hard  drugs  are  two  different  things.  Entheogens  are  great  for  spiritual  experience,  but  they  are  like  a  stepping  stone,  and  should  be  replaced  by  meditation,  because  meditation  is  the  ultimate  drug.

Your  link  provides  no  specific  references  to  studies  or  specific  scientific  data.  It  simply  makes  statements.  For  example:    "Although  it  has  yet  to  be  proven  conclusively  that  heavy  marijuana  use  can  cause  irreversible  loss  of  intellectual  capacity,  animal  studies  have  shown  marijuana-induced  structural  damage  to  portions  of  the  brain  essential  to  memory  and  learning.  "    And  even  within  those  statements,  nothing  is  conclusive.  You'd  think  after  all  this  time  at  least  SOMETHING  would  be  conclusive,  no?  Here's  some  conclusive  evidence  on  a  legal  substance,  Alchol:      http://www.uleth.ca/alcohol/  affects2.html        "Serious  disease  of  the  liver  and  pancreas,  and  damage  to  the  stomach  and  intestines  can  result  from  excessive  use  of  alcohol.

In  addition  to  that,  there  are  many  trustworthy  dispensaries  (essentially  a  pot  store  with  a  menu,  etc.)  here  in  California  that  I  can  safely  get  access  to  clean  medicine.	0
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]1.  Tobacco  is  _the_  most  addictive  substance  known  to  man.  Comparing  it  to  cannabis  in  this  way  is  a  joke.    2.  The  numbers  for  marijuana  related  auto  deaths  compared  to  alcohol  are  laughable.  Keep  in  mind  many  people  also  drive  while  on  vicoden,  anti-depressents,  etc.  The  lesson  here  is  don't  drive  if  your  fucked  up  (on  anything).    3.  Pfffffff.  Arguing  that  the  government  would  regulate  it  in  a  way  that  would  increase  the  price  is  ridiculous.  If  I  could  buy  a  'pack'  of  marijuana  cigarettes  for  the  same  price  as  tobacco,  even  while  tobacco  is  heavily  taxed,  that  would  be  awesome  and  very  very  cheap.  Have  you  heard  the  numbers  that  the  government  has  been  considering?  I've  heard  $50  a  plant  for  growing  -  a  single  plant  can  procure  about  6  grand  worth  of  medicine.  It's  still  going  to  be  cheap.    4.  Just  because  you  don't  like  it  or  how  it  effects  other  people  gives  you  no  right  to  make  choices  for  others.  Just  like  just  because  I  don't  like  drinking  doesn't  mean  I  think  everyone  should  be  banned  from  drinking.    Even  if  you  think  Legalizing  is  not  the  solution  -  the  war  on  drugs  is  also  NOT  the  solution.  A  good  solution  might  be  to  change  the  war  on  drugs  to  be  the  war  on  addiction,  and  then  also  legalize  pot.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.

Weed  on  its  own  isn't  too  bad  (apart  from  obviously  the  effects  of  smoking  it  on  your  lungs),  it  is  the  shit  that  dealers  put  into  it  to  bulk  it  up  to  make  more  money  that  effects  people.      I  have  to  agree  with  your  last  comment  though.  You  should  never  think  weed,  cigarettes  or  alcohol  are  totally  harmless.	0

I  don't  think  that  it  should  be  legalized  but  at  the  same  time  I  think  that  it  should  be  decriminalized.        The  drug,  or  all  drugs  for  that  matter,  have  an  effect  on  society.  It's  not  just  about  the  individuals  safety.  We  already  have  tobacco  and  alcohol,  if  we  make  either  illegal  there  will  be  a  riot,  jobs  will  be  lost  and  so  on.  If  we  add  another  drug  to  the  legal  market,  that's  just  another  way  to  waste  time.        People  in  this  country  act  like  everyone  owes  them  something,  like  their  8  hour  shift  at  work  is  all  that  is  expected  of  them  and  that's  all  that  they  have  to  do.  Anything  more  is  a  waste  of  their  time  because  they  could  be  spending  it  doing  something  that  they  want  to  do.  Sure,  that's  the  American  dream.  Work,  go  home  and  plan  your  next  vacation,  maybe  sit  back  and  relax  with  a  beer.  Watch  television  and  talk  about  the  "good  ol  times"  with  your  buddy...  That's  a  societal  waste  though.  Anytime  you  sit  back  you're  wasting  time,  like  I  am  right  now,  and  you,  reading  this  (I'm  using  cognitive  processes  to  contribute  to  an  idea  that  other  people  can  read,  appreciate,  or  better,  disagree  with,  so  technically  neither  you  nor  I  are  really  wasting  time,  but  you  and  I  could  be  doing  better).        Basically  society  is  constantly  rotting  under  our  feet,  and  all  these  people  want  to  do  while  it's  happening  is  get  high,  drunk,  or  take  a  cigarette  break!  There  is  work  to  be  done,  quite  your  bitching  and  get  to  it.	1
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]1.  Tobacco  is  _the_  most  addictive  substance  known  to  man.  Comparing  it  to  cannabis  in  this  way  is  a  joke.    2.  The  numbers  for  marijuana  related  auto  deaths  compared  to  alcohol  are  laughable.  Keep  in  mind  many  people  also  drive  while  on  vicoden,  anti-depressents,  etc.  The  lesson  here  is  don't  drive  if  your  fucked  up  (on  anything).    3.  Pfffffff.  Arguing  that  the  government  would  regulate  it  in  a  way  that  would  increase  the  price  is  ridiculous.  If  I  could  buy  a  'pack'  of  marijuana  cigarettes  for  the  same  price  as  tobacco,  even  while  tobacco  is  heavily  taxed,  that  would  be  awesome  and  very  very  cheap.  Have  you  heard  the  numbers  that  the  government  has  been  considering?  I've  heard  $50  a  plant  for  growing  -  a  single  plant  can  procure  about  6  grand  worth  of  medicine.  It's  still  going  to  be  cheap.    4.  Just  because  you  don't  like  it  or  how  it  effects  other  people  gives  you  no  right  to  make  choices  for  others.  Just  like  just  because  I  don't  like  drinking  doesn't  mean  I  think  everyone  should  be  banned  from  drinking.    Even  if  you  think  Legalizing  is  not  the  solution  -  the  war  on  drugs  is  also  NOT  the  solution.  A  good  solution  might  be  to  change  the  war  on  drugs  to  be  the  war  on  addiction,  and  then  also  legalize  pot.[SEP]One  question,  why  do  people  have  to  do  it  in  the  first  place?  Are  they  that  bored  with  their  lives  they  need  an  extra  boost  to  make  them  feel  something?  If  people  didn't  do  the  drugs  in  the  first  place,  that  would  be  the  solution,  not  legalizing  or  keeping  it  illegal.  But  I  guess  people  are  just  dumb,  that's  all.  If  pot  wasn't  addictive,  as  most  people  claim,  they  can  just  stop  doing  it  right?[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	1

What  does  that  mean  about  your  natural  state  though,  your  worth  as  a  human  without  it?  There  are  ways,  maybe  too  primitive  for  this  generation  of  "successful  actors"  and  counters  to  accept,  but  it's  far  more  effective  in  the  long  run  and  you  have  a  better  understanding  shit  while  you're  doing  it  and  afterwords  too...  it's  called  "discipline".  A  trick  that  seems  to  be  all  but  forgotten,  today...  I  wonder  if  it's  because  anyone  can  just  go  grab  some  form  of  "medication"  to  make  themselves  appreciate  their  own  work  and  the  world  around  them.      ---------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------  -----------        Honestly,  I  find  it  both  morally  and  ethically  corrupt  to  even  desire  a  substance  for  pleasure,  let  alone  demand  it  come  easier.  The  ultimate  weakness  and  surest  sign  of  gluttony,  bitching  about  your  unnecessary  substances.      "I  know  many,  many,  many  other  people  that  fit  this  criteria  as  well."      So  what?  Many,  many,  many  other  people  strive  to  define  humanity  as  something  other  than  a  waste  of  billions  of  years  of  evolution  and  suffering  for  burnt  plant  fumes  that  create  a  careless  and  happy  go  lucky  floaty  feeling.      I'm  one  of  those  people  that  know  the  meaning  and  worth  of  discipline.  There's  something  sacred  about  reality  and  the  way  that  the  earth  is  when  it's  "dull"  and  quiet  that  no  one  seems  to  get...  everything  needs  to  be  brilliantly  colorful,  exciting,  relaxing,  whatever,  some  form  of  artificial  stimulation  needs  to  be  administered  to  get  any  good  experience  out  of  anything.  It  can't  just  be  left  alone  and  truly  appreciated  the  way  it  is.      I  don't  have  a  problem  with  the  drug,  I  have  a  problem  with  people.  I  don't  have  a  problem  with  people,  but  that  they  still  act  like  animals.  I  feel  like  I'm  the  only  real  human  left,  like  the  only  person  I'm  fighting  for  is  myself,  to  show  myself  that  I'm  not  a  monster  like  the  rest  of  you.  That  I'm  actually  worth  the  effort  put  forth  by  my  bloodline  a  million  fold  because  I  am  different.  I  won't  lay  down  because  it  feels  good,  I  won't  lay  down  because  "I  need  a  break"  in  my  finite  life  of  only  23  years,  I  won't  lay  down  because  I  deserve  it!      Laying  down  is  for  the  weak.  That's  what  you  fools  are  doing.  You  just  want  you  weed  because  the  alcohol,  cigarettes,  caffein,  television,  shopping  malls  aren't  good  enough.  You  just  want  your  plant.      Now,  I  bit  good  riddance  to  you  and  your  damned  marijuana,  I  have  work  to  do.	1

It  can't  just  be  left  alone  and  truly  appreciated  the  way  it  is.      I  don't  have  a  problem  with  the  drug,  I  have  a  problem  with  people.  I  don't  have  a  problem  with  people,  but  that  they  still  act  like  animals.  I  feel  like  I'm  the  only  real  human  left,  like  the  only  person  I'm  fighting  for  is  myself,  to  show  myself  that  I'm  not  a  monster  like  the  rest  of  you.  That  I'm  actually  worth  the  effort  put  forth  by  my  bloodline  a  million  fold  because  I  am  different.  I  won't  lay  down  because  it  feels  good,  I  won't  lay  down  because  "I  need  a  break"  in  my  finite  life  of  only  23  years,  I  won't  lay  down  because  I  deserve  it!      Laying  down  is  for  the  weak.  That's  what  you  fools  are  doing.  You  just  want  you  weed  because  the  alcohol,  cigarettes,  caffein,  television,  shopping  malls  aren't  good  enough.  You  just  want  your  plant.

You  think  it's  morally  corrupt  to  want  to  do  something  that  makes  you  feel  good?  And  we  are  animals.  The  belief  that  humans  are  somehow  above  doing  things  that  make  us  feel  us  good  makes  no  sense.  You're  23,  you  still  have  a  lot  to  learn  about  life.    "You  just  want  you  weed  because  the  alcohol,  cigarettes,  caffein,  television,  shopping  malls  aren't  good  enough."    Hmm  you  seem  to  be  using  the  internet  as  a  source  of  entertainment.  Apparently  you're  the  one  who  needs  artificial  stimulation.  Quite  pretending  to  be  better  than  everyone  else  and  realize  your  hypocrisy.	0
I  don't  think  that  it  should  be  legalized  but  at  the  same  time  I  think  that  it  should  be  decriminalized.        The  drug,  or  all  drugs  for  that  matter,  have  an  effect  on  society.  It's  not  just  about  the  individuals  safety.  We  already  have  tobacco  and  alcohol,  if  we  make  either  illegal  there  will  be  a  riot,  jobs  will  be  lost  and  so  on.

Basically  society  is  constantly  rotting  under  our  feet,  and  all  these  people  want  to  do  while  it's  happening  is  get  high,  drunk,  or  take  a  cigarette  break!

The  drug,  or  all  drugs  for  that  matter,  have  an  effect  on  society.  It's  not  just  about  the  individuals  safety.  We  already  have  tobacco  and  alcohol,  if  we  make  either  illegal  there  will  be  a  riot,  jobs  will  be  lost  and  so  on.  If  we  add  another  drug  to  the  legal  market,  that's  just  another  way  to  waste  time.        People  in  this  country  act  like  everyone  owes  them  something,  like  their  8  hour  shift  at  work  is  all  that  is  expected  of  them  and  that's  all  that  they  have  to  do.  Anything  more  is  a  waste  of  their  time  because  they  could  be  spending  it  doing  something  that  they  want  to  do.  Sure,  that's  the  American  dream.  Work,  go  home  and  plan  your  next  vacation,  maybe  sit  back  and  relax  with  a  beer.  Watch  television  and  talk  about  the  "good  ol  times"  with  your  buddy...  That's  a  societal  waste  though.  Anytime  you  sit  back  you're  wasting  time,  like  I  am  right  now,  and  you,  reading  this  (I'm  using  cognitive  processes  to  contribute  to  an  idea  that  other  people  can  read,  appreciate,  or  better,  disagree  with,  so  technically  neither  you  nor  I  are  really  wasting  time,  but  you  and  I  could  be  doing  better).        Basically  society  is  constantly  rotting  under  our  feet,  and  all  these  people  want  to  do  while  it's  happening  is  get  high,  drunk,  or  take  a  cigarette  break!  There  is  work  to  be  done,  quite  your  bitching  and  get  to  it.[SEP]Dude,  I  dunno  about  other  shit,  but  I'm  productive  as  hell  on  pot.  In  fact,  it's  often  the  difference  between  me  being  able  to  function  or  not.  This  is  how  medicines,  function,  though,  so  it's  only  natural.  I  know  many,  many  other  people  that  fit  this  criteria  as  well.    There  are  people  that  handle  large  amounts  of  money  (stock  brokers,  bankers,  etc.)  who  smoke  pot  on  a  regular  basis.  There  are  a  number  of  extremely  successful  celebrities  who  smoke  pot.  Just  because  our  society  associates  laziness  with  stoner's  doesn't  mean  pot  makes  you  lazy.  Thinking  pot  makes  you  lazy  when  you  smoke  it  will  make  you  lazy  when  you  smoke  it,  though.  Read  that  last  sentence  again,  it's  a  bit  confusing,  but  is  very  true.[SEP]It's  always  easier  to  medicate  yourself  to  increase    preferred    performance...  What  does  that  mean  about  your  natural  state  though,  your  worth  as  a  human  without  it?  There  are  ways,  maybe  too  primitive  for  this  generation  of  "successful  actors"  and  counters  to  accept,  but  it's  far  more  effective  in  the  long  run  and  you  have  a  better  understanding  shit  while  you're  doing  it  and  afterwords  too...  it's  called  "discipline".  A  trick  that  seems  to  be  all  but  forgotten,  today...  I  wonder  if  it's  because  anyone  can  just  go  grab  some  form  of  "medication"  to  make  themselves  appreciate  their  own  work  and  the  world  around  them.      ---------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------  -----------        Honestly,  I  find  it  both  morally  and  ethically  corrupt  to  even  desire  a  substance  for  pleasure,  let  alone  demand  it  come  easier.  The  ultimate  weakness  and  surest  sign  of  gluttony,  bitching  about  your  unnecessary  substances.      "I  know  many,  many,  many  other  people  that  fit  this  criteria  as  well."      So  what?  Many,  many,  many  other  people  strive  to  define  humanity  as  something  other  than  a  waste  of  billions  of  years  of  evolution  and  suffering  for  burnt  plant  fumes  that  create  a  careless  and  happy  go  lucky  floaty  feeling.      I'm  one  of  those  people  that  know  the  meaning  and  worth  of  discipline.  There's  something  sacred  about  reality  and  the  way  that  the  earth  is  when  it's  "dull"  and  quiet  that  no  one  seems  to  get...  everything  needs  to  be  brilliantly  colorful,  exciting,  relaxing,  whatever,  some  form  of  artificial  stimulation  needs  to  be  administered  to  get  any  good  experience  out  of  anything.  It  can't  just  be  left  alone  and  truly  appreciated  the  way  it  is.      I  don't  have  a  problem  with  the  drug,  I  have  a  problem  with  people.  I  don't  have  a  problem  with  people,  but  that  they  still  act  like  animals.  I  feel  like  I'm  the  only  real  human  left,  like  the  only  person  I'm  fighting  for  is  myself,  to  show  myself  that  I'm  not  a  monster  like  the  rest  of  you.  That  I'm  actually  worth  the  effort  put  forth  by  my  bloodline  a  million  fold  because  I  am  different.  I  won't  lay  down  because  it  feels  good,  I  won't  lay  down  because  "I  need  a  break"  in  my  finite  life  of  only  23  years,  I  won't  lay  down  because  I  deserve  it!      Laying  down  is  for  the  weak.  That's  what  you  fools  are  doing.  You  just  want  you  weed  because  the  alcohol,  cigarettes,  caffein,  television,  shopping  malls  aren't  good  enough.  You  just  want  your  plant.      Now,  I  bit  good  riddance  to  you  and  your  damned  marijuana,  I  have  work  to  do.[SEP]I  agree.  I  hate  how  their's  so  many  shows  nowadays  about  how  pot  should  be  legalized  or  how  theirs  shows  that  show  the  medical  pot  stores  in  california  and  how  pople  hold  rallies  and  riot  to  try  and  get  pot  legalized.  I  have  smoked  pot  atleast  150+  times  in  my  life(i  haven't  smoked  pot  in  atleast  7+  months,  and  have  only  smoked  it  4  times  in  the  last  4  years),  so  i  know  what  it's  like  to  be  high,  and  the  only  way  i  could  see  someone  thinking  that  marijuanna  is  a  medicine  would  be  if  your  high  when  you  say  that.  Their  is  no  way  that  marijuanna  could  be  a  medicine.  I  hated  the  feeling  of  being  high,  and  if  you  look  up  Cannabis  and  mental  disorders,  then  you'll  find  that  cannabis  does  more  harm  to  you  than  good(the  only  reason  people  say  it's  good  is  because  it  numbs  them  and  makes  the  pain  go  away).        I  personally  think  that  if  they  legalize  it,  then  The  United  States  will  sooner  or  later  fall  apart.	1
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]1.  Tobacco  is  _the_  most  addictive  substance  known  to  man.  Comparing  it  to  cannabis  in  this  way  is  a  joke.    2.  The  numbers  for  marijuana  related  auto  deaths  compared  to  alcohol  are  laughable.  Keep  in  mind  many  people  also  drive  while  on  vicoden,  anti-depressents,  etc.  The  lesson  here  is  don't  drive  if  your  fucked  up  (on  anything).    3.  Pfffffff.  Arguing  that  the  government  would  regulate  it  in  a  way  that  would  increase  the  price  is  ridiculous.  If  I  could  buy  a  'pack'  of  marijuana  cigarettes  for  the  same  price  as  tobacco,  even  while  tobacco  is  heavily  taxed,  that  would  be  awesome  and  very  very  cheap.  Have  you  heard  the  numbers  that  the  government  has  been  considering?  I've  heard  $50  a  plant  for  growing  -  a  single  plant  can  procure  about  6  grand  worth  of  medicine.  It's  still  going  to  be  cheap.    4.  Just  because  you  don't  like  it  or  how  it  effects  other  people  gives  you  no  right  to  make  choices  for  others.  Just  like  just  because  I  don't  like  drinking  doesn't  mean  I  think  everyone  should  be  banned  from  drinking.    Even  if  you  think  Legalizing  is  not  the  solution  -  the  war  on  drugs  is  also  NOT  the  solution.  A  good  solution  might  be  to  change  the  war  on  drugs  to  be  the  war  on  addiction,  and  then  also  legalize  pot.[SEP]One  question,  why  do  people  have  to  do  it  in  the  first  place?  Are  they  that  bored  with  their  lives  they  need  an  extra  boost  to  make  them  feel  something?  If  people  didn't  do  the  drugs  in  the  first  place,  that  would  be  the  solution,  not  legalizing  or  keeping  it  illegal.  But  I  guess  people  are  just  dumb,  that's  all.  If  pot  wasn't  addictive,  as  most  people  claim,  they  can  just  stop  doing  it  right?[SEP]We  do  it  because  we  enjoy  it.  The  same  applies  to  watching  tv,  exercise,  drinking  tea,  etc.  We  don't  have  to  do  it  and  often  go  long  periods  of  time  without  smoking  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	0

People  who  are  intoxicated  constantly,  regardless  of  the  drug,  are  unlikely  to  be  productive  members  of  society.  There  is  nothing  about  marijuana  specifically  that  causes  people  to  lose  their  drive  and  ambition.  In  laboratory  studies,  subjects  given  high  doses  of  marijuana  for  several  days  or  even  several  weeks  exhibit  no  decrease  in  work  motivation  or  productivity.  Among  working  adults,  marijuana  users  tend  to  earn  higher  wages  than  non-users.  College  students  who  use  marijuana  have  the  same  grades  as  nonusers.  Among  high  school  students,  heavy  use  is  associated  with  school  failure,  but  school  failure  usually  comes  first.	0

I  completely  disagree  with  this  statement  and  it  goes  against  any  scientific  proof.  Studies  have  been  done  that  prove  if  you  take  breaks  and  have  more  leisure  time  you  are  a  much  more  effective  worker.  Now  obviously  if  you  are  neglecting  your  responsibilities  leisure  is  bad.  But  that  in  no  way  implies  that  you  have  to  be  always  working.    In  your  next  response  you  talk  about  how  you  morally  think  doing  things  that  are  unproductive  or  enjoyable  are  wrong.  I  have  several  problems  with  this.  First  off,  honestly  I'm  not  you  and  neither  is  anyone  else  why  should  we  have  to  be  held  accountable  to  your  unreasonable  and  arbitrary  morals.  Second  off  if  we  never  did  stop  working  productivity  would  fall  because  everyone  would  be  unhappy.  Unhappy  people  are  not  productive.

If  you  are  going  to  tell  people  whether  they  can  or  cannot  use  substances  such  as  Cannabis;  than  at  least  have  a  better  reason  than  your  supposed  morals  that  almost  half  the  country  disagrees  with.  You  admit  to  being  hypocritical  about  your  no-leisure  rule  by  being  on  the  internet  rather  than  doing  something  productive  and  who  is  to  say  that  is  all  your  hypocritical  about.  So  even  you  don't  follow  your  own  ethics/morals.    But  that  is  besides  the  point,  as  a  completely  productive  citizen  who  works  full  time  and  goes  to  school  full  time,  why  do  I  have  to  go  through  illegal  channels  to  enjoy  a  healthier  substance  (Cannabis)  than  a  legal  substance  (Alcohol)  in  my  spare  time.  Decriminalization  is  not  enough.  The  game  is  over,  we  know  that  Cannabis  is  no  worse  and  possibly  better  than  Alcohol  and  denying  people  the  right  to  a  trustworthy  and  accountable  Cannabis  industry  is  authoritarian  at  best.	0

Look  at  book  camp  as  an  example.  Sure  it's  tough,  but  what  isn't  that  you're  trying  to  do  well.

So  even  you  don't  follow  your  own  ethics/morals."      I  am  being  hypocritical,  but  that's  not  the  point.  Leisure  doesn't  require  marijuana,  or  any  other  drug.  Contributing  an  argument  is  anything  but  leisure.      "But  that  is  besides  the  point,  as  a  completely  productive  citizen  who  works  full  time  and  goes  to  school  full  time,  why  do  I  have  to  go  through  illegal  channels  to  enjoy  a  healthier  substance  (Cannabis)  than  a  legal  substance  (Alcohol)  in  my  spare  time.  Decriminalization  is  not  enough.  The  game  is  over,  we  know  that  Cannabis  is  no  worse  and  possibly  better  than  Alcohol  and  denying  people  the  right  to  a  trustworthy  and  accountable  Cannabis  industry  is  authoritarian  at  best."*      You  have  this  idea,  that  by  doing  what  is  expected  of  you  by  todays  society,  that  you're  doing  good.	1
I  don't  think  that  it  should  be  legalized  but  at  the  same  time  I  think  that  it  should  be  decriminalized.        The  drug,  or  all  drugs  for  that  matter,  have  an  effect  on  society.  It's  not  just  about  the  individuals  safety.  We  already  have  tobacco  and  alcohol,  if  we  make  either  illegal  there  will  be  a  riot,  jobs  will  be  lost  and  so  on.  If  we  add  another  drug  to  the  legal  market,  that's  just  another  way  to  waste  time.        People  in  this  country  act  like  everyone  owes  them  something,  like  their  8  hour  shift  at  work  is  all  that  is  expected  of  them  and  that's  all  that  they  have  to  do.  Anything  more  is  a  waste  of  their  time  because  they  could  be  spending  it  doing  something  that  they  want  to  do.  Sure,  that's  the  American  dream.  Work,  go  home  and  plan  your  next  vacation,  maybe  sit  back  and  relax  with  a  beer.  Watch  television  and  talk  about  the  "good  ol  times"  with  your  buddy...  That's  a  societal  waste  though.  Anytime  you  sit  back  you're  wasting  time,  like  I  am  right  now,  and  you,  reading  this  (I'm  using  cognitive  processes  to  contribute  to  an  idea  that  other  people  can  read,  appreciate,  or  better,  disagree  with,  so  technically  neither  you  nor  I  are  really  wasting  time,  but  you  and  I  could  be  doing  better).        Basically  society  is  constantly  rotting  under  our  feet,  and  all  these  people  want  to  do  while  it's  happening  is  get  high,  drunk,  or  take  a  cigarette  break!  There  is  work  to  be  done,  quite  your  bitching  and  get  to  it.[SEP]"That's  a  societal  waste  though.  Anytime  you  sit  back  you're  wasting  time,  like  I  am  right  now,  and  you,  reading  this."      I  completely  disagree  with  this  statement  and  it  goes  against  any  scientific  proof.  Studies  have  been  done  that  prove  if  you  take  breaks  and  have  more  leisure  time  you  are  a  much  more  effective  worker.  Now  obviously  if  you  are  neglecting  your  responsibilities  leisure  is  bad.  But  that  in  no  way  implies  that  you  have  to  be  always  working.    In  your  next  response  you  talk  about  how  you  morally  think  doing  things  that  are  unproductive  or  enjoyable  are  wrong.  I  have  several  problems  with  this.  First  off,  honestly  I'm  not  you  and  neither  is  anyone  else  why  should  we  have  to  be  held  accountable  to  your  unreasonable  and  arbitrary  morals.  Second  off  if  we  never  did  stop  working  productivity  would  fall  because  everyone  would  be  unhappy.  Unhappy  people  are  not  productive.  Society  would  not  operate  like  this  so  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect  people  to  operate  without  leisure  time.    If  you  are  going  to  tell  people  whether  they  can  or  cannot  use  substances  such  as  Cannabis;  than  at  least  have  a  better  reason  than  your  supposed  morals  that  almost  half  the  country  disagrees  with.

There  are  a  lot  of  jobs  that  require  people  to  stay  active  for  long  periods  of  time,  I  don't  see  them  handing  out  weed  and  duritos  and  telling  people  to  take  an  enjoyable  break.  Look  at  book  camp  as  an  example.  Sure  it's  tough,  but  what  isn't  that  you're  trying  to  do  well.      "In  your  next  response  you  talk  about  how  you  morally  think  doing  things  that  are  unproductive  or  enjoyable  are  wrong.  I  have  several  problems  with  this.

Society  would  not  operate  like  this  so  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect  people  to  operate  without  leisure  time."      This  is  hilarious.  You  decline  to  recognize  any  validity  in  my  morals  or  even  that  I  mentioned  ethics  as  well,  but  holy  shit,  it's  so  important  to  me  that  you're  unhappy  without  your  substance...        "If  you  are  going  to  tell  people  whether  they  can  or  cannot  use  substances  such  as  Cannabis;  than  at  least  have  a  better  reason  than  your  supposed  morals  that  almost  half  the  country  disagrees  with.

Contributing  an  argument  is  anything  but  leisure.      "But  that  is  besides  the  point,  as  a  completely  productive  citizen  who  works  full  time  and  goes  to  school  full  time,  why  do  I  have  to  go  through  illegal  channels  to  enjoy  a  healthier  substance  (Cannabis)  than  a  legal  substance  (Alcohol)  in  my  spare  time.

You  also  seem  to  think  I  am  saying  it  would  be  okay  to  do  leisurely  activities  while  on  the  job  which  I  didn't.  However  if  your  responsibilities  are  finished  it  is  better  you  enjoy  yourself  than  be  a  robot  who  thinks  its  wrong  to  enjoy  things  be  it  cannabis,  alcohol,  food,  sex,  whatever.  Either  way,  ethics  or  morals  it  doesn't  matter  I  still  don't  see  why  someone  else  ought  to  live  by  your  personal  ethics/morals.      And  your  correct  that  leisure  does  not  require  marijuana  however  some  people  enjoy  using  marijuana  in  their  leisure  time.  And  unless  we  want  to  set  up  a  draconian  system  to  make  all  pleasures  wrong  (which  you  would  probably  support)  it  is  hypocritical  to  allow  some  substances  and  not  others,  especially  if  those  other  substances  are  less  harmful.    You  still  have  not  given  a  reason  to  keep  drugs  illegal.  It  is  an  inconsistent  argument  and  if  we  want  to  start  taking  away  one  persons  right  to  what  they  enjoy  in  their  spare  time  when  will  it  stop?  I  may  not  know  what  you  personally  enjoy  but  I  should  not  have  the  right  to  deprive  you  of  your  enjoyment  if  your  not  harming  anyone  else.    As  far  as  a  study  that  proves  happier  workers  are  more  productive  here  is  one  of  the  first  articles  that  came  up  with  google,  mind  you  I  didn't  search  for  long...      http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/  workinglife/article990727.ece        The  use  of  marijuana  hurts  no  one  but  the  individual  who  choses  to  use  it.  Why  should  it  be  anyone  else's  choice  whether  they  hurt  themselves  or  not.  And  if  they  do  abuse  marijuana  to  the  point  of  harming  themselves  how  is  it  the  substances  fault?  Should  we  criminalize  knives  because  I  could  possibly  slit  my  own  wrists?  I  really  don't  believe  your  completely  consistent  with  your  line  of  thinking.  But  you  could  be.  My  question  is  who  gets  to  determine  these  arbitrary  rules?  Because  that  is  all  drug  criminalization  is,  for  the  most  part  just  a  random  arbitrary  law  for  no  reason  other  than  control.	0

Here  is  one  site  that  says  so.      http://www.stopblocking.org/?p=35      I  should  add  that  legalizing  marijuana  would  mean  an  end  to  destructive  mandatory  sentencing  of  long  jail  times,  which  has  ruined  so  many  young  peoples  lives.  So  it  would  be  worth  it  to  legalize  just  for  this  reason  alone.	0

nah,  if  they  legalize  pot,  there  would  be  no  fun  in  smoking  it.  its  fun  because  (???)  IT  IS  Freaking  ILLEGAL,  which  is  frikin  cool.

Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Great  argument  Burke!  ````````````````````````````````````````[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	1
if  we  legalize  pot  there  wil  be  a  sharp  increase  in  demand  and  consumption  over  a  period  of  time  then............it  will  start  to  decline....slowly  at  first  until  smoking  pot  becomes  drinking  wine.......only  on  special  occasions...........that's  why  we  should  continue  the  war  it's  not  like  weed  is  damn  near  impossible  to  obtain......in  my  opinion  there  is  no  war.......there  never  was...	1
How  could  you  be  so  ignorant  to  do  drugs  anyways?  The  one  thing  that  a  drug  targets  is  the  brain,  it  alters  and  cripples  every  thought,  it  kills  people,  it  depresses  them,  and  marijuana  fits  in  all  of  those  positions.  And  drug  users  do  this  for  social  mobility?  Comfort?  And  isolation?  It  seems  very  pointless  to  me,  and  it  will  affect  everyone  around  you  because  anyone  can  be  a  victim.  I  support  to  end  drugs.	1

For  instance,  I  think  it's  okay  to  take  drugs  in  the  privacy  in  your  own  home  without  an  intent  to  hurt  anyone  else.    However,  if  you  were  home  with  your  family,  got  high,  and  began  to  do  dangerous  things  or  hurt  your  family  because  of  your  getting  high  -  that's  not  okay.    As  long  as  the  only  'victim'  -  if  there  even  is  one  -  is  yourself,  I  don't  think  anyone  should  really  have  a  say  in  what  you  do.	0
Yes,  we  would  take  away  the  war  between  us  and  mexico.  but  if  we  have  to  chose  between  that  and  the  cartel  shooting  in  our  streets  I  know  which  one  I  would  chose.  There  is  always  a  double  effect.  One  thing  happens  causing  another.  If  we  legalize  then  the  cartel  will  move  here  to  make  a  larger  profit.  That  would  cause  an  effect  that  makes  america  fall.  We  would  have  shootings  in  our  streets  and  detectives  being  forced  to  shut  up.	1

Since  it  isn't  legal  in  any  country  in  the  whole  world,  then  if  we  legalize  it,  all  the  gangs  who  sell  cannabis  will  move  to  the  United  States,  because  they  can  do  their  operation  without  getting  in  trouble.  We  would  be  taken  over  by  the  Mexican  Cartel,  plus  the  cartel  would  most  likely  rob  every  Marijuanna  store  their  is.	1

At  the  end  of  your  "essay"  you  act  as  though  it  was  good  to  legalize  alcohol  in  the  first  place.  Just  because  something  is  legal  now  doesn't  mean  that  it  should  have  been  in  the  first  place,  and  second,  i  think  that  marijuanna  shouldn't  be  legalized  is  because(no  matter  what  potheads  say)  their  has  been  research  done  on  the  effects  of  smoking  Cannabis,  and  the  results  were  not  good.  Just  go  on  google  and  type  in  something  like  "Cannabis  and  mental  disorders"  or  something  like  that,  and  you'll  find  a  ton  of  sites  that  show  the  research  that  Cannabis  is  bad  for  your  brain.  Have  you  ever  noticed  that  the  only  people  who  want  to  legalize  pot  are  people  who  smoke  it  themselves,  or  are  related  to  someone  who  does.  All  i  have  to  say  is  that  science(research)  will  have  the  final  say  into  whether  or  not  it's  bad  for  you.	1
First  of  all,  those  pot  smokers  that  want  it  legalized  are  total  idiots.  All  that  will  mean  is  that  it  will  be  heavily  taxed.  And  this  is  why  the  war  should  continue,  because  there  are  plenty  of  other  drugs  far  worse  than  marijuana,  which  will  become  much  more  desirable  and  widespread  when  the  demand  for  pot  decreases  because  of  the  increased  cost.  Basically,  the  legalization  of  one  drug  will  help  to  advance  the  cause  of  other  drugs,  making  them  more  acceptable  to  society.  I  personally  don't  want  to  live  in  a  world  where  meth  is  a  legal  drug.	1
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Great  argument  Burke!  ````````````````````````````````````````[SEP]Please  explain  to  me  why  that  is  such  a  great  argument.............[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.

Secondly,  if  it  were  completely  legal,  priced  and  taxed  similar  to  tobacco  (which  is  HEAVILY  taxed),  it  would  be  a  drop  in  the  bucket.  I  would  love  to  pay  for  pot  what  tobacco  smokers  pay  for  tobacco.    Currently,  obviously,  cannabis  is  illegal.  Currently,  also,  cannabis  is  a  gateway  drug  because  the  same  people  that  end  up  handling  it,  handle  other  hard  core  drugs.  If  it  were  legal,  those  people  would  have  no  desire  to  traffic  marijuana  because  there  would  be  no  underground  market  (like  there  is  no  underground  market  for  tobacco  and  alcohol).  Therefore,  marijuana  would  no  longer  be  a  gateway  drug.    Making  the  argument  that  marijuana  legalization  would  lead  to  Meth  legalization,  and  THATS  why  we  shouldn't  legalize  is  pretty  poor.  Especially  considering  you  have  no  references  or  evidence.	0

Marijuana  is  safer  than  some  other  legal  substances,  so  you  can't  ban  it  for  that  reason.  Also  you  must  realize  that  a  prohibition  simply  does  not  work.  Pot  smoking  is  still  a  very  common  phenomena  despite  it  being  illegal.  legalization,  sales,  and  taxation  of  marijuana  would  be  hugely  beneficial  to  the  economy.    Also  there  is  not  a  single  bit  of  scientific  evidence  that  can  link  marijuana  usage  to  other  drug  usage.  Your  entire  argument  rests  entirely  on  speculation.	0

And  also,  maybe  if  we  legalized  weed  which  has  less  health  problems  as  opposed  to  cigs  and  alcohol,  we  wouldn't  have  to  legalize  meth,  because  it  has  shown  it's  devastating  to  your  health.

You  have  nothing  to  back  this  view  up  and  the  history  of  prohibition  would  actually  disagree  with  your  statement.    "the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  if  you  smoke  pot  long  enough  your  mind  will  strictly  be  wrapped  around  trying  to  get  high."    Marijuana  is  not  physically  addictive.  Yet  one  of  the  most  addictive  substances  known,  nicotine,  is  perfectly  legal  to  have  in  cigarettes.  Alcohol  is  also  very  illegal.  There  are  thousands  of  deaths  every  year  from  tobacco  and  alcohol,  yet  there  has  never  been  a  recorded  death  due  to  marijuana.  Unless  you  support  making  cigarettes  and  alcohol  illegal,  your  position  is  not  logically  consistent.    Furthermore  your  assumption  that  people  who  smoke  pot  are  not  productive  members  of  society  is  simply  not  the  case.  50%  of  the  population  has  smoked  marijuana  at  least  one  time.  And  the  past  three  presidents  have  admitted  to  smoking  pot.  You  can  very  easily  be  a  very  successful  habitual  smoker,  but  it  is  far  more  difficult  to  be  a  fully  functional  alcoholic.  Yet  once  again  I  doubt  you  support  prohibition  of  alcohol.    Your  argument  is  based  upon  incorrect  assumptions  and  contradictions.  Try  again.	0

Sure,  that's  just  me  but  come  on.  Are  you  really  telling  me  that  people  who  don't  do  it  NOW  are  going  to  do  it  if  it's  legalized?  If  someone  wants  to  do  it,  they're  going  to  do  it  whether  or  not  it's  legal  (proof  is  everyone  smoking  pot  today).  Anyways,  how  many  people  do  you  know  to  smoke  pot?  From  the  sound  of  it,  everyone  must,  because  you're  saying  that  EVERYONE  will  be  hooked  on  the  stuff  if  it  becomes  legalized.  I  don't  think  that  many  people  (including  the  person  or  people  that  will,  'cure  cancer')  want  to  waste  their  time  smoking  it.  This  is  strictly  from  my  point  of  view,  and  I'm  only  pointing  out  that  there  is  a  vast  majority  of  people  who  do  not  smoke  now.  What  does  that  mean?  There  will  be  (HOPEFULLY!)  a  vast  majority  of  people  who  don't  smoke,  if  and  when  marijuana  becomes  legalized.  Just  because  a  lot  of  people  drink  doesn't  mean  everyone  does.  Just  because  a  lot  of  people  smoke  cigarettes  doesn't  mean  every  person  does.  And  just  because  a  lot  of  people  overeat  certainly  does  not  mean  that  everyone  does.  Consider  athletes,  for  example.  I'm  not  so  sure  that  if  it  actually  is  legalized  everything  will  be  perfect,  but  then  again  nothing  is,  really.  If  one  looks  at  alcohol  there  is  still  a  giant  reoccuring  problem  with  drinking  and  driving.  Despite  educational  tools  used  in  schools,  teens  still  do  it;  even  adults  do.  There  will  always  be  people  who  think  they  are  capable  of  doing  something  they  are  clearly  not.	0
First  of  all,  those  pot  smokers  that  want  it  legalized  are  total  idiots.  All  that  will  mean  is  that  it  will  be  heavily  taxed.  And  this  is  why  the  war  should  continue,  because  there  are  plenty  of  other  drugs  far  worse  than  marijuana,  which  will  become  much  more  desirable  and  widespread  when  the  demand  for  pot  decreases  because  of  the  increased  cost.  Basically,  the  legalization  of  one  drug  will  help  to  advance  the  cause  of  other  drugs,  making  them  more  acceptable  to  society.  I  personally  don't  want  to  live  in  a  world  where  meth  is  a  legal  drug.[SEP]The  reasons  for  why  pot  should  be  legalized  are  all  legitamite  but  people  are  only  looking  at  the  big  picture.  Sure  it  can  benifet  society  in  many  ways  but  their  are  so  many  down  sides  to  legalizing  pot.  If  everyone  were  to  become  pot  attics  they  would  become  more  and  more  addicting  up  to  the  point  that  all  they  want  to  do  is  smoke  pot.  Allot  of  people  are  probably  reading  this  and  thinking  that  i  am  completly  wrong,  but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  if  you  smoke  pot  long  enough  your  mind  will  strictly  be  wrapped  around  trying  to  get  high.  With  that  said,  how  will  our  society  progress  if  every  has  their  minds  on  obtaining  pot.  Our  world  will  not  become  more  advanced  because  everyone  who  was  one  smart  is  now  a  pot  head!  Who  will  be  the  guy  to  cure  cancer  if  everyone  is  on  pot??[SEP]Lol  dude  one  of  my  good  friends  smokes  pot  everyday  and  has  been  for  a  year,  he  is  currently  the  valedictorian  of  our  high  school...  He  also  goes  to  work  everyday  while  high  as  does  exactly  the  same  as  everyone  else!?!?  Do  you  still  think  pot  makes  you  stupid?	0
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Great  argument  Burke!  ````````````````````````````````````````[SEP]Please  explain  to  me  why  that  is  such  a  great  argument.............[SEP]Don't  you  know  a  good  argument  when  you  see  one  even  if  it  doesn't  agree  with  your  point  of  view?[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	1
First  off,  the  only  people  that  want  to  legalize  pot  are  the  liberals  that  sit  around  all  day,  living  off  wellfare  and  smoke  drugs.  They  do  this  because  they  are  to  uneducated  to  get  a  job,  and  figure  the  liberal  government  will  whipe  their  behind  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.

Technically  speaking,  the  war  on  drugs  does  employ  people.  So  that's  a  plus  to  it,  right?  Besides,  marijuana  is  illegal  for  a  reason.  People  abuse  the  drug  as  it  is.  If  they  legalize  it,  the  abuse  will  grow  exponentially.  This  applies  for  any  illegal  substance.  If  alcohol  is  made  legal,  for  example,  underaged  drinkers  would  drink  so  much  more  than  they  did  when  it  was  legal.  Of  course,  this  could  slow  down  over  time,  but  do  we  really  want  that  initial  boom  of  drug  abuse  which  we  don't  know  when  it  will  end?	1

You  literally  are  feeling  the  effects  of  a  poisoning  of  your  system  and  a  hangover  is  usually  just  dehydration  sickness.  It's  a  pointless  drug  that  people  are  allowed  to  ingest  because  it  makes  them  stupid,  but  many  do  seem  to  enjoy  it.      Recently  a  bill  was  introduced  into  the  California  Legislature  that  called  for  the  legalization  of  Marijuana  in  the  state.  In  the  bill  it  stated  that  the  industry  created  from  this  would  bring  in  more  that  a  billion  dollars  in  tax  revenue.  That's  just  the  tax  revenue  it  would  generate  and  just  in  California.    As  to  your  point  about  private  growers:    Do  you  grow  your  own  food?....  I  rest  my  case.  It's  a  matter  of  convenience.  Some  will  do  it  ,yes,  but  most  won't.    And  people  can  and  do  grow  their  own  tobacco.  I  have  a  few  friends  who  carry  around  a  bag  of  tobacco  and  rolling  papers  for  cigarettes  precisely  for  the  reason  you  stated.  Personally,  I  find  cigarettes  to  be  even  worse  that  alcohol.  The  only  positive  your  system  ever  feels  from  a  cigarette  is  the  quench  of  a  physical  addiction  due  to  the  nature  of  the  substance.	0

People  don't  just  smoke  marijuana.  it  can  be  made  into  a  variety  of  things  for  very  cheap.  It  has  long  been  speculated  that  if  it  were  legal  it  would  rock  textile  industry  to  it's  core.  Hemp  used  to  be  used  for  making  rope  and  paper,  the  constitution  in  fact  is  written  on  hemp,  but  not  anymore.  It  has  even  been  suggested  that  the  textiles  industry  is  in  on  keeping  the  drug  war  going  just  to  protect  their  market.  So,  your  argument  is  completely  wrong,  because  of  it's  many  uses  and  how  easy  it  is  to  grow  (we  are  talking  about  weed  here,  it  often  grows  in  spite  of  efforts  to  stop  it)  marijuana  would  most  certainly  become  a  muliti  billion  dollar  industry  if  legalized.	0

Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Great  argument  Burke!  ````````````````````````````````````````[SEP]Please  explain  to  me  why  that  is  such  a  great  argument.............[SEP]Don't  you  know  a  good  argument  when  you  see  one  even  if  it  doesn't  agree  with  your  point  of  view?[SEP]Sure,  I'm  just  wanting  to  know  WHY.  It's  a  simple  question.  What,  specifically,  made  it  a  good  one?[SEP]Simply  put,  Burke  made  good  points  on  all  sides  and  he's  right  about  almost  everything  he's  written.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	1

Technically  speaking,  the  war  on  drugs  does  employ  people.  So  that's  a  plus  to  it,  right?  Besides,  marijuana  is  illegal  for  a  reason.  People  abuse  the  drug  as  it  is.  If  they  legalize  it,  the  abuse  will  grow  exponentially.  This  applies  for  any  illegal  substance.  If  alcohol  is  made  legal,  for  example,  underaged  drinkers  would  drink  so  much  more  than  they  did  when  it  was  legal.

I  got  enough  opposition.  :)    But  when  I  look  into  legalizing  something,  I  try  to  look  at  the  worst  case  scenario  and  a  likely  scenario  and  combine  them.  In  the  case  of  pot,  I'm  sure  a  lot  of  people  would  go  out  and  buy  it  to  try  it  or  buy  it  to  continue  their  addictions  (don't  say  it's  not  addicting.  I    know    people  that  are  addicted.)  Worst  case  scenario,  half  the  population  would  go  out  and  buy  it,  get  high  and  wreak  havoc  on  America.  Productivity  would  go  down  :)  and  some  people  would  simply  do  reckless  things.	1
I  will  argue  first  from  a  practical  position,  then  philosophical,  then  historical.    Marijuana  is  not  dangerous.  There  has  been  a  death  recorded  due  to  marijuana.  The  LD50  or  amount  that  it  would  take  to  kill  half  the  population  is  incredibly  high.  Far  higher.  You  can  reasonably  say  it  is  so  high,  it  is  impossible  to  die  from  overdosing  on  marijuana.  Also  marijuana  does  not  make  you  stupid.  The  reason  people  think  this,  is  that  there  was  a  study  done  on  monkey  where  they  let  them  breathe  only  marijuana  smoke  and  they  died  from  hypoxia  or  lack  of  oxygen.  When  you  die  from  a  lack  of  oxygen,  your  brain  cells  die.  The  severe  errors  in  the  study,  however,  were  released  much  later  than  the  results  so  there  is  now  a  stigma  that  marijuana  use  makes  you  stupid.  They  have  found  that  smoking  marijuana  does  not  cause  cancer  like  cigarette  smoke.  A  UCLA  study  found  no  link.  The  gateway  drug  theory  is  actually  perpetuated  by  the  prohibition  of  marijuana.  Because  marijuana  users  must  get  pot  from  drug  dealers,  they  are  exposed  to  harder,  dangerous  drugs.  If  marijuana  was  able  to  be  sold  in  stores,  this  would  not  happen.  Legalizing  marijuana  would  not  lead  to  an  increase  in  use  by  children.  According  to  many  studies,  it  is  vastly  easier  for  teenagers  to  get  marijuana  than  it  is  for  them  them  to  get  alcohol.  This  is  because  alcohol  must  be  purchased  through  legal  channels  where  vendors  check  for  IDs.  However,  because  of  the  black  market  for  marijuana  drug  dealers  do  not  care  how  old  someone  is  when  they  sell  them  pot.  The  legalization  of  marijuana  will  be  very  good  for  the  economy.  We  spend  billions  of  dollars  each  year  to  keep  people  in  prison  because  they  like  to  get  high  and  relax.  Additionally  marijuana  is  a  huge  cash  crop  the  government  could  make  a  lot  of  money  off  from  taxation.  It  is  the  number  one  cash  crop  in  California  for  example.  ~60%  of  the  money  of  Mexican  drug  cartels  is  earned  by  selling  marijuana  in  the  US.  Severely  compromising  their  funding  would  reduce  crime  in  the  United  States  as  well  as  Mexico,  which  would  help  improve  Mexico's  living  conditions  and  curb  illegal  immigration  into  the  United  States.    The  government  should  not  have  a  right  to  prohibit  you  from  doing  something  to  yourself  that  does  not  harm  anyone  else.  It  is  not  illegal  to  go  home  and  drink  a  gallon  of  paint  thinner,  but  I  guarantee  that  it's  much  better  for  both  you  and  society  that  you  smoke  marijuana  instead  of  drinking  paint  thinner.  Here's  a  more  reasonable  example:  Should  the  government  make  it  illegal  to  consume  significantly  more  calories  than  you  expend?  This  is  much  more  harmful  than  marijuana,  and  obesity  related  illnesses  are  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death.  The  bottom  line  is  that  this  type  of  reasoning  that  the  government  needs  to  be  able  to  protect  you  from  yourself  is  dangerously  close  to  fascism.  Where  do  you  draw  the  line?  Do  we  monitor  people's  jobs  and  make  it  illegal  to  not  work  hard  to  make  sure  people  are  productive  and  that  they  get  promoted?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  be  late  for  job  interviews  because  that  is  bad  for  you?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  sleep  in  beds  instead  of  on  the  floor  because  people  have  died  this  way  and  no  one  has  ever  died  from  marijuana?  The  answer  is  no.  Adults  are  free  to  make  their  own  decisions  that  only  affect  themselves.  We  do  not  live  in  a  "nanny-state"  as  Ron  Paul  puts  it.    Many  people  assume  that  because  marijuana  is  illegal  serious  research  and  thinking  went  into  the  decision  to  ban  it.  This  simply  isn't  true.  The  first  marijuana  laws  in  the  United  States  forced  people  to  grow  marijuana  during  colonial  times.  Marijuana  became  illegal  for  a  few  reasons.  One  was  due  to  extreme  anti-Latino  and  anti-black  sentiment.  People  were  fear  mongered  into  believing  that  minorities  were  a  danger  to  white  society  especially  due  to  marijuana.  The  "reefer  madness"  campaign  created  undue  hysteria.  Yellow  journalism  and  personal  career  advancement  also  played  a  role.  In  fact  President  Nixon  commissioned  a  report  on  marijuana  which  concluded  that  marijuana  should  not  be  illegal.    http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/  Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm        The  next  logical  question  is  why  is  marijuana  still  illegal.  Again  there  are  a  few  reasons.  What  kept  it  illegal  during  the  middle  and  late  1900s  was  again  a  fear  mongering  campaign  linking  marijuana  use  and  communism.  By  this  point  in  history  there  is  so  much  social  stigma  against  marijuana,  that  if  you  ask  someone  against  legalization  why  it  should  be  illegal,  they  will  most  likely  cite  things  that  simply  aren't  true.  Additionally  the  alcohol  and  tobacco  industries  are  absolutely  huge.  Companies  in  those  industries  make  a  so  much  money  that  they  can  spend  vast  amounts  lobbying  congress  to  keep  marijuana  illegal.  They  don't  want  competition.  Why  would  you  drink  or  smoke  tobacco  when  they  are  incredibly  dangerous  and  addictive  when  you  can  smoke  marijuana  which  is  harmless  and  not  addictive?  Many  people  underestimate  the  effect  that  a  large  lobby  can  have  on  national  and  state  policy.  The  alcohol  and  tobacco  companies  also  perpetuate  the  social  stigma  against  marijuana  by  funding  anti-drug  and  anti-marijuana  advertisements  and  programs.  The  goal  of  these  programs  is  not  to  make  you  not  do  drugs,  its  to  stop  you  from  doing  drugs  that  they  don't  sell  you.  Also  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes  is  a  huge  threat  to  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  The  pharmaceutical  industry  is  the  biggest  industry  in  the  United  States.  Just  like  the  tobacco  and  alcohol  companies,  pharmaceutical  companies  spend  millions  of  dollars  lobbying  congress.  Marijuana  has  been  some  doctors  as  the  single  best  drug  for  maintaining  health.  It  combats  an  astonishing  number  of  diseases  and  conditions,  and  has  no  side  effects.  Compare  that  to  the  multitude  of  side  effects  from  prescription  drugs.  It  has  become  a  cliche  how  at  the  end  of  television  commercials  for  prescription  drugs  they  rattle  off  a  long  list  of  some  pretty  serious  side  effects.  Thousands  of  people  die  from  adverse  reactions  to  prescription  drugs.    As  I  hope  you  can  see,  the  prohibition  of  marijuana  is  completely  wrong  on  many  levels.  Making  marijuana  legal  will  keep  it  away  from  kids,  keep  people  away  from  dangerous  hard  drugs,  and  allow  adults  to  make  their  own  choices  when  it  comes  to  their  own  lives.	0

This  didn't  happen  with  prohibition  of  alcohol  and  it  didn't  happen  when  Amsterdam  legalized  marijuana  and  it  didn't  happen  when  Portugal  decriminalized  all  drugs.      "don't  say  it's  not  addicting.  I  know  people  that  are  addicted"      I  will  say  it  isn't  addictive  because  it  is  not  physically  addictive.  I  don't  care  how  much  anecdotal  evidence  you  have,  it  has  been  proven  to  not  be  physically  addictive.  While  cigarettes  and  alcohol  are  incredibly  addictive,  yet  you  seem  to  be  okay  with  them.      "Worst  case  scenario,  half  the  population  would  go  out  and  buy  it,  get  high  and  wreak  havoc  on  America."      You  are  completely  making  that  proportion  up.  It  is  based  on  absolutely  no  evidence.  You  would  be  just  a  justified  if  you  literally  picked  a  random  number  because  that  is  basically  what  you  did.    And  what  havoc  do  you  think  people  wreak  on  America  that  do  it  now.  Once  again  as  you  failed  to  acknowledge  marijuana  does  not  cause  reckless  and  uncontrollable  actions  like  alcohol  does.  Yet  once  again  I  doubt  you  support  the  prohibition  of  alcohol.      "Productivity  would  go  down"      And  again  another  statement  based  totally  on  social  stigma  and  no  actual  evidence.    I  challenge  you  to  cite  one  negative  result  of  legalizing  marijuana  that  does  not  apply  to  alcohol  or  cigarettes  that  you  actually  have  a  shred  of  evidence.  I  really  don't  think  you  can  come  up  with  a  single  one.  If  you  can,  prove  me  wrong.  Once  again  it  cannot  also  apply  to  alcohol  or  cigarettes  and  must  be  have  evidence.  Don't  speculate  or  provide  anecdotal  evidence.	0

Annual  deaths  in  the  US  from  tobacco:  435,000    Annual  deaths  in  the  US  from  alcohol:  85,000    Total  recorded  deaths  due  to  marijuana:  0    I'm  not  so  sure  people  understand  the  harm  that  comes  from  them.    I  don't  see  how  you  can  support  prohibition  of  marijuana,  but  not  alcohol  and  tobacco  without  realizing  what  a  hypocrite  you  are.  Alcohol  and  tobacco  are  far  worse  no  matter  what  metric  you  use.      "Just  because  pot  may  not  be  physically  addicting,  does  not  mean  it  is  not  mentally  addicting,  which  is  just  as  bad.  It  means  your  brain  is  hooked  and  can't  function  without  it.  "      No  you  can  still  function  without  it,  you  are  thinking  about  the  addiction  that  comes  from  cigarettes  which  you  support.  Marijuana  can  be  psychologically  addictive.  All  that  means  is  that  if  you  really  like  the  feeling  of  being  high,  you  will  want  to  do  it  again.  This  does  not  mean  you  are  not  able  to  not  do  it.  Anything  that  you  enjoy  can  be  psychologically  addictive  (Sex,  gambling,  createdebate.com).  Even  if  marijuana  were  addictive  like  cigarettes  and  alcohol,  you  cannot  use  this  point  to  argue  against  legalization  unless  you  support  prohibition  of  alcohol  and  tobacco.  As  I  said  name  something  bad  that  it  doesn't  have  in  common  with  those  two  drugs.      "They  tend  to  forget  that  marijuana  smoke  is  6  times  worse  than  cigarette  smoke,  when  it  comes  to  carbon  monoxide  and  the  toxicity  of  the  smoke  itself."      You  have  one  misleading  and  one  incorrect  fact  there.  Marijuana  smoke  has  been  shown  to  not  cause  cancer.  Scientists  hypothesized  that  it  would  cause  cancer  because  it  contains  more  harmful  chemicals,  but  when  they  did  actual  studies  on  live  animals,  they  found  absolutely  no  link  between  marijuana  and  any  form  of  cancer.  This  is  just  one  study  by  UCLA  I  can  get  more  if  you  desire  them.      http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html      So  while  it  may  be  true  that  it  contains  more  harmful  chemicals,  for  whatever  reason  it  still  doesn't  cause  cancer.      In  reference  to  the  toxicity  of  the  smoke,  you  couldn't  be  more  wrong.  Scientists  have  not  been  able  to  induce  death  in  an  animal  due  to  marijuana.  It's  LD50,  or  quantity  that  would  be  lethal  to  half  the  population,  is  so  high,  that  we  cannot  even  find  it.  It  is  physically  impossible  to  overdose  on  marijuana  and  consequently  there  has  never  been  a  recorded  death  due  to  it.      http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mj_overdose.htm      I  have  absolutely  no  idea  what  you  are  talking  about  when  you  say  smoke  causes  "little  nicks"  in  arteries.  Please  cite  an  article  or  study  because  what  you  are  saying  makes  no  sense.    The  study  you  cited  by  the  British  Lung  Foundation  doesn't  appear  to  have  been  published  in  a  peer  reviewed  medical  journal  like  the  studies  that  show  marijuana  is  not  harmful.  Here  is  why  the  study  is  misleading.    They  start  out  with  a  very  bold  statement    "Smoking  pure  cannabis  is  more  harmful  to  lungs  than  tobacco,  a  health  charity  is  warning."    So  you  continue  on  reading  to  see  how  exactly  they  proved  that.    First  "evidence":    "A  study  by  the  British  Lung  Foundation  found  that  just  three  cannabis  joints  a  day  cause  the  same  damage  as  20  cigarettes.  "    First  of  all  it  is  very  uncommon  to  smoke  three  joints  a  day.  Secondly  they  were  most  likely  comparing  unfiltered  joints  and  filtered  joints  which  is  really  intellectually  dishonest.  They  also  don't  talk  about  what  type  of  damage  they  are  referring  to.  Marijuana  smoke  does  temporarily  paralyze  the  cilia  or  small  hairs  in  your  air  passageways  which  can  temporarily  increase  the  risk  of  colds  and  other  upper  respiratory  tract  infections(OH  NO).  The  smoke  does  not  cause  permanent  damage  to  the  lungs.  Furthermore  there  are  other  ways  to  ingest  marijuana,  including  water  filtering  which  removes  a  significant  amount  of  tar  and  dangerous  chemicals,  vaporizing  which  releases  only  the  THC  and  no  harmful  chemicals,  and  eating  which  also  releases  no  tar  or  dangerous  chemicals.    Second  "evidence":    "Evidence  shows  that  tar  from  cannabis  cigarettes  contains  50%  more  cancer  causing  carcinogens  than  tobacco.  "    As  I  said  earlier  this  is  a  really  dishonest  thing  to  say.  While  it  may  contain  more  carcinogens,  it  doesn't  cause  cancer.  Numerous  studies  have  failed  to  find  any  link.  Yet  there  are  an  immeasurable  number  of  studies  that  show  the  direct  link  between  tobacco  smoke  and  cancer.  Think  about  it,  if  marijuana  smoke  was  so  much  worse  than  tobacco  smoke,  or  even  bad  all,  why  are  there  no  studies  showing  it  actually  causes  cancer,  but  so  many  showing  tobacco  causes  cancer.  There  is  even  research  marijuana  may  kill  cancerous  cells  and  leave  healthy  cells  alone.      http://www.salem-news.com/articles/  january112008/cancer_treatment_11008.php                                                                                      As  I  said,  they  don't  have  any  concrete  evidence  that  it  causes  health  problems.  It  is  not  enough  to  say  it  contains  dangerous  chemicals.  Especially  when  numerous  studies  show  the  chemicals  don't  cause  damage.    You  still  somehow  manage  to  fail  to  name  one  negative  result  of  legalizing  marijuana  that  does  not  apply  to  alcohol  or  cigarettes  with  evidence.  Every  thing  you  named  once  again  is  present  in  alcohol  or  tobacco  and  most  of  them  weren't  true.    So  once  again  I  ask  you  to  name  a  negative  result  of  marijuana  that  isn't  present  in  tobacco  or  alcohol.  And  don't  give  me,  'it's  too  late  to  make  alcohol  and  tobacco  illegal.'  First  of  all  it  is  never  too  late,  that  is  a  cop  out.  But  regardless  of  the  pragmatism  of  making  them  illegal,  I'll  bet  you  still  don't  think  we  should.	0
Technically  speaking,  the  war  on  drugs  does  employ  people.  So  that's  a  plus  to  it,  right?  Besides,  marijuana  is  illegal  for  a  reason.  People  abuse  the  drug  as  it  is.  If  they  legalize  it,  the  abuse  will  grow  exponentially.  This  applies  for  any  illegal  substance.  If  alcohol  is  made  legal,  for  example,  underaged  drinkers  would  drink  so  much  more  than  they  did  when  it  was  legal.

I  got  enough  opposition.  :)    But  when  I  look  into  legalizing  something,  I  try  to  look  at  the  worst  case  scenario  and  a  likely  scenario  and  combine  them.  In  the  case  of  pot,  I'm  sure  a  lot  of  people  would  go  out  and  buy  it  to  try  it  or  buy  it  to  continue  their  addictions  (don't  say  it's  not  addicting.  I    know    people  that  are  addicted.)  Worst  case  scenario,  half  the  population  would  go  out  and  buy  it,  get  high  and  wreak  havoc  on  America.  Productivity  would  go  down  :)  and  some  people  would  simply  do  reckless  things.[SEP]For  the  record,  smoking  marijuana  is  not  the  only  way  to  enjoy  it.      So,  while  y'all  can  debate  the  harmful  effects  of  smoking  it,  just  keep  in  mind  that  really  none  of  them  can  be  valid  arguments  of  keeping  it  illegal.	0

But  if  it  were  to  be  legalized  for  all  purposes  aside  from  smoking,  people  could  much  more  easily  get  their  hands  on  it  for  smoking.    Besides,  I  have  a  problem  with  the  actual  drug  itself,  not  just  the  smoke.  Smoking  ANYTHING  is  bad.	1

Alcohol  which  you  think  should  be  legal.  "    Yes,  alcohol  does  cause  brain  damage-  in  minors.  As  we  mature,  our  neurons  deposit  a  compound  called  myelin  around  the  axon  of  a  dendrite.  These  myelin  deposits  are  known  as  Schwann  cells  and  their  purpose  is  to  make  transmitting  information  quicker.  Electrical  impulses  simply  skip  over  these  sections  and  go  from  node  to  node  much  quicker  than  if  they  weren't  there.  That's  why  it  is  illegal  up  until  21,  when  this  stage  of  development  has  stopped  and  cannot  be  harmed  any  longer.    Truth  is,  smoking    anything    is  bad  for  you.  The  only  difference  is  that  marijuana  smoke  has  way  more  carbon  monoxide.  Inhaling  this  will  limit  the  amount  of  oxygen  that  can  go  to  your  brain  and  can  kill  brain  cells  if  they  do  not  get  enough  oxygen.  It  could  also  cause  other  parts  of  the  body  to  not  get  enough  oxygen,  like  the  muscles  and  the  heart.  This  is  why  when  people  are  high,  they  slow  down.    And  no,  cigarette  smoking  has  not  been  scientifically  proven.  The  only  way  to  prove  this  would  be  to  formulate  an  experiment  where  you  assign  X  amount  of  people  to  smoke  10  packs  a  day  or  whatever  and  X  amount  of  people  to  smoke  nothing  for  20  years  and  get  back  to  them  to  compare  results.  This  is  an  unethical  experiment  and  cannot  be  done  since  one  part  of  the  study  could  lead  to  death.  (I  took  a  stats  course  and  we  discussed  this  in  depth  for  a  day.)    And  the  website  was  about  tobacco  smoke.  I  knew  that.  But  I  deliberately  pointed  out  that  it  mentioned  how  carbon  monoxide  can  harm  the  blood  vessels,  which  is  present  in  marijuana  smoke  as  well.	1

Your  heart  rate  actually  increases  from  ingesting  THC.  Once  again  you  demonstrate  how  little  you  know  about  this.    You  are  trying  to  reference  the  fact  that  correlation  does  not  prove  causation.  While  they  may  have  never  proven  100%  that  if  you  smoke  you  will  very  likely  get  cancer,  observational  studies  on  humans  have  shown  an  incredibly  strong  link  between  smoking  cigarettes  and  developing  cancer.  This  is  good  enough  proof  for  medicine.    But  marijuana  does  not  harm  your  blood  vessels.  Find  me  a  source  that  says  it  does.	0
Technically  speaking,  the  war  on  drugs  does  employ  people.  So  that's  a  plus  to  it,  right?  Besides,  marijuana  is  illegal  for  a  reason.  People  abuse  the  drug  as  it  is.  If  they  legalize  it,  the  abuse  will  grow  exponentially.  This  applies  for  any  illegal  substance.  If  alcohol  is  made  legal,  for  example,  underaged  drinkers  would  drink  so  much  more  than  they  did  when  it  was  legal.

Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.	1
I  will  argue  first  from  a  practical  position,  then  philosophical,  then  historical.    Marijuana  is  not  dangerous.  There  has  been  a  death  recorded  due  to  marijuana.  The  LD50  or  amount  that  it  would  take  to  kill  half  the  population  is  incredibly  high.  Far  higher.  You  can  reasonably  say  it  is  so  high,  it  is  impossible  to  die  from  overdosing  on  marijuana.  Also  marijuana  does  not  make  you  stupid.  The  reason  people  think  this,  is  that  there  was  a  study  done  on  monkey  where  they  let  them  breathe  only  marijuana  smoke  and  they  died  from  hypoxia  or  lack  of  oxygen.  When  you  die  from  a  lack  of  oxygen,  your  brain  cells  die.  The  severe  errors  in  the  study,  however,  were  released  much  later  than  the  results  so  there  is  now  a  stigma  that  marijuana  use  makes  you  stupid.  They  have  found  that  smoking  marijuana  does  not  cause  cancer  like  cigarette  smoke.  A  UCLA  study  found  no  link.  The  gateway  drug  theory  is  actually  perpetuated  by  the  prohibition  of  marijuana.  Because  marijuana  users  must  get  pot  from  drug  dealers,  they  are  exposed  to  harder,  dangerous  drugs.  If  marijuana  was  able  to  be  sold  in  stores,  this  would  not  happen.  Legalizing  marijuana  would  not  lead  to  an  increase  in  use  by  children.  According  to  many  studies,  it  is  vastly  easier  for  teenagers  to  get  marijuana  than  it  is  for  them  them  to  get  alcohol.  This  is  because  alcohol  must  be  purchased  through  legal  channels  where  vendors  check  for  IDs.  However,  because  of  the  black  market  for  marijuana  drug  dealers  do  not  care  how  old  someone  is  when  they  sell  them  pot.  The  legalization  of  marijuana  will  be  very  good  for  the  economy.  We  spend  billions  of  dollars  each  year  to  keep  people  in  prison  because  they  like  to  get  high  and  relax.  Additionally  marijuana  is  a  huge  cash  crop  the  government  could  make  a  lot  of  money  off  from  taxation.  It  is  the  number  one  cash  crop  in  California  for  example.  ~60%  of  the  money  of  Mexican  drug  cartels  is  earned  by  selling  marijuana  in  the  US.  Severely  compromising  their  funding  would  reduce  crime  in  the  United  States  as  well  as  Mexico,  which  would  help  improve  Mexico's  living  conditions  and  curb  illegal  immigration  into  the  United  States.    The  government  should  not  have  a  right  to  prohibit  you  from  doing  something  to  yourself  that  does  not  harm  anyone  else.  It  is  not  illegal  to  go  home  and  drink  a  gallon  of  paint  thinner,  but  I  guarantee  that  it's  much  better  for  both  you  and  society  that  you  smoke  marijuana  instead  of  drinking  paint  thinner.  Here's  a  more  reasonable  example:  Should  the  government  make  it  illegal  to  consume  significantly  more  calories  than  you  expend?  This  is  much  more  harmful  than  marijuana,  and  obesity  related  illnesses  are  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death.  The  bottom  line  is  that  this  type  of  reasoning  that  the  government  needs  to  be  able  to  protect  you  from  yourself  is  dangerously  close  to  fascism.  Where  do  you  draw  the  line?  Do  we  monitor  people's  jobs  and  make  it  illegal  to  not  work  hard  to  make  sure  people  are  productive  and  that  they  get  promoted?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  be  late  for  job  interviews  because  that  is  bad  for  you?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  sleep  in  beds  instead  of  on  the  floor  because  people  have  died  this  way  and  no  one  has  ever  died  from  marijuana?  The  answer  is  no.  Adults  are  free  to  make  their  own  decisions  that  only  affect  themselves.  We  do  not  live  in  a  "nanny-state"  as  Ron  Paul  puts  it.    Many  people  assume  that  because  marijuana  is  illegal  serious  research  and  thinking  went  into  the  decision  to  ban  it.  This  simply  isn't  true.  The  first  marijuana  laws  in  the  United  States  forced  people  to  grow  marijuana  during  colonial  times.  Marijuana  became  illegal  for  a  few  reasons.  One  was  due  to  extreme  anti-Latino  and  anti-black  sentiment.  People  were  fear  mongered  into  believing  that  minorities  were  a  danger  to  white  society  especially  due  to  marijuana.  The  "reefer  madness"  campaign  created  undue  hysteria.  Yellow  journalism  and  personal  career  advancement  also  played  a  role.  In  fact  President  Nixon  commissioned  a  report  on  marijuana  which  concluded  that  marijuana  should  not  be  illegal.    http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/  Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm        The  next  logical  question  is  why  is  marijuana  still  illegal.  Again  there  are  a  few  reasons.  What  kept  it  illegal  during  the  middle  and  late  1900s  was  again  a  fear  mongering  campaign  linking  marijuana  use  and  communism.  By  this  point  in  history  there  is  so  much  social  stigma  against  marijuana,  that  if  you  ask  someone  against  legalization  why  it  should  be  illegal,  they  will  most  likely  cite  things  that  simply  aren't  true.  Additionally  the  alcohol  and  tobacco  industries  are  absolutely  huge.  Companies  in  those  industries  make  a  so  much  money  that  they  can  spend  vast  amounts  lobbying  congress  to  keep  marijuana  illegal.  They  don't  want  competition.  Why  would  you  drink  or  smoke  tobacco  when  they  are  incredibly  dangerous  and  addictive  when  you  can  smoke  marijuana  which  is  harmless  and  not  addictive?  Many  people  underestimate  the  effect  that  a  large  lobby  can  have  on  national  and  state  policy.  The  alcohol  and  tobacco  companies  also  perpetuate  the  social  stigma  against  marijuana  by  funding  anti-drug  and  anti-marijuana  advertisements  and  programs.  The  goal  of  these  programs  is  not  to  make  you  not  do  drugs,  its  to  stop  you  from  doing  drugs  that  they  don't  sell  you.  Also  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes  is  a  huge  threat  to  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  The  pharmaceutical  industry  is  the  biggest  industry  in  the  United  States.  Just  like  the  tobacco  and  alcohol  companies,  pharmaceutical  companies  spend  millions  of  dollars  lobbying  congress.  Marijuana  has  been  some  doctors  as  the  single  best  drug  for  maintaining  health.  It  combats  an  astonishing  number  of  diseases  and  conditions,  and  has  no  side  effects.  Compare  that  to  the  multitude  of  side  effects  from  prescription  drugs.  It  has  become  a  cliche  how  at  the  end  of  television  commercials  for  prescription  drugs  they  rattle  off  a  long  list  of  some  pretty  serious  side  effects.  Thousands  of  people  die  from  adverse  reactions  to  prescription  drugs.    As  I  hope  you  can  see,  the  prohibition  of  marijuana  is  completely  wrong  on  many  levels.  Making  marijuana  legal  will  keep  it  away  from  kids,  keep  people  away  from  dangerous  hard  drugs,  and  allow  adults  to  make  their  own  choices  when  it  comes  to  their  own  lives.[SEP]Very  well  put.  Excellent  work.  You  have  tackled  the  debate  from  many  different  angles  and  have  covered  a  lot  of  ground  from  many  different  perspectives.  Hopefully  this  educates  a  large  number  of  individuals.	0

Because  marijuana  users  must  get  pot  from  drug  dealers,  they  are  exposed  to  harder,  dangerous  drugs.  If  marijuana  was  able  to  be  sold  in  stores,  this  would  not  happen.  Legalizing  marijuana  would  not  lead  to  an  increase  in  use  by  children.  According  to  many  studies,  it  is  vastly  easier  for  teenagers  to  get  marijuana  than  it  is  for  them  them  to  get  alcohol.  This  is  because  alcohol  must  be  purchased  through  legal  channels  where  vendors  check  for  IDs.  However,  because  of  the  black  market  for  marijuana  drug  dealers  do  not  care  how  old  someone  is  when  they  sell  them  pot.  The  legalization  of  marijuana  will  be  very  good  for  the  economy.  We  spend  billions  of  dollars  each  year  to  keep  people  in  prison  because  they  like  to  get  high  and  relax.  Additionally  marijuana  is  a  huge  cash  crop  the  government  could  make  a  lot  of  money  off  from  taxation.  It  is  the  number  one  cash  crop  in  California  for  example.  ~60%  of  the  money  of  Mexican  drug  cartels  is  earned  by  selling  marijuana  in  the  US.  Severely  compromising  their  funding  would  reduce  crime  in  the  United  States  as  well  as  Mexico,  which  would  help  improve  Mexico's  living  conditions  and  curb  illegal  immigration  into  the  United  States.    The  government  should  not  have  a  right  to  prohibit  you  from  doing  something  to  yourself  that  does  not  harm  anyone  else.  It  is  not  illegal  to  go  home  and  drink  a  gallon  of  paint  thinner,  but  I  guarantee  that  it's  much  better  for  both  you  and  society  that  you  smoke  marijuana  instead  of  drinking  paint  thinner.  Here's  a  more  reasonable  example:  Should  the  government  make  it  illegal  to  consume  significantly  more  calories  than  you  expend?  This  is  much  more  harmful  than  marijuana,  and  obesity  related  illnesses  are  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death.  The  bottom  line  is  that  this  type  of  reasoning  that  the  government  needs  to  be  able  to  protect  you  from  yourself  is  dangerously  close  to  fascism.  Where  do  you  draw  the  line?  Do  we  monitor  people's  jobs  and  make  it  illegal  to  not  work  hard  to  make  sure  people  are  productive  and  that  they  get  promoted?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  be  late  for  job  interviews  because  that  is  bad  for  you?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  sleep  in  beds  instead  of  on  the  floor  because  people  have  died  this  way  and  no  one  has  ever  died  from  marijuana?  The  answer  is  no.  Adults  are  free  to  make  their  own  decisions  that  only  affect  themselves.  We  do  not  live  in  a  "nanny-state"  as  Ron  Paul  puts  it.    Many  people  assume  that  because  marijuana  is  illegal  serious  research  and  thinking  went  into  the  decision  to  ban  it.  This  simply  isn't  true.  The  first  marijuana  laws  in  the  United  States  forced  people  to  grow  marijuana  during  colonial  times.  Marijuana  became  illegal  for  a  few  reasons.  One  was  due  to  extreme  anti-Latino  and  anti-black  sentiment.  People  were  fear  mongered  into  believing  that  minorities  were  a  danger  to  white  society  especially  due  to  marijuana.  The  "reefer  madness"  campaign  created  undue  hysteria.  Yellow  journalism  and  personal  career  advancement  also  played  a  role.  In  fact  President  Nixon  commissioned  a  report  on  marijuana  which  concluded  that  marijuana  should  not  be  illegal.    http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/  Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm        The  next  logical  question  is  why  is  marijuana  still  illegal.  Again  there  are  a  few  reasons.  What  kept  it  illegal  during  the  middle  and  late  1900s  was  again  a  fear  mongering  campaign  linking  marijuana  use  and  communism.  By  this  point  in  history  there  is  so  much  social  stigma  against  marijuana,  that  if  you  ask  someone  against  legalization  why  it  should  be  illegal,  they  will  most  likely  cite  things  that  simply  aren't  true.  Additionally  the  alcohol  and  tobacco  industries  are  absolutely  huge.  Companies  in  those  industries  make  a  so  much  money  that  they  can  spend  vast  amounts  lobbying  congress  to  keep  marijuana  illegal.  They  don't  want  competition.  Why  would  you  drink  or  smoke  tobacco  when  they  are  incredibly  dangerous  and  addictive  when  you  can  smoke  marijuana  which  is  harmless  and  not  addictive?  Many  people  underestimate  the  effect  that  a  large  lobby  can  have  on  national  and  state  policy.  The  alcohol  and  tobacco  companies  also  perpetuate  the  social  stigma  against  marijuana  by  funding  anti-drug  and  anti-marijuana  advertisements  and  programs.  The  goal  of  these  programs  is  not  to  make  you  not  do  drugs,  its  to  stop  you  from  doing  drugs  that  they  don't  sell  you.  Also  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes  is  a  huge  threat  to  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  The  pharmaceutical  industry  is  the  biggest  industry  in  the  United  States.  Just  like  the  tobacco  and  alcohol  companies,  pharmaceutical  companies  spend  millions  of  dollars  lobbying  congress.  Marijuana  has  been  some  doctors  as  the  single  best  drug  for  maintaining  health.  It  combats  an  astonishing  number  of  diseases  and  conditions,  and  has  no  side  effects.  Compare  that  to  the  multitude  of  side  effects  from  prescription  drugs.  It  has  become  a  cliche  how  at  the  end  of  television  commercials  for  prescription  drugs  they  rattle  off  a  long  list  of  some  pretty  serious  side  effects.  Thousands  of  people  die  from  adverse  reactions  to  prescription  drugs.    As  I  hope  you  can  see,  the  prohibition  of  marijuana  is  completely  wrong  on  many  levels.  Making  marijuana  legal  will  keep  it  away  from  kids,  keep  people  away  from  dangerous  hard  drugs,  and  allow  adults  to  make  their  own  choices  when  it  comes  to  their  own  lives.[SEP]I  know  there  is  no  point  in  complaining  about  down  votes,  but  I  just  want  to  remind  everyone  especially  the  people  who  just  down  voted  me  that  you  are  not  supposed  to  do  down  vote  arguments  you  disagree  with.

If  they  were  legal  and  the  government  focused  on  harm  reduction,  there  would  be  less  of  a  problem.  Look  at  the  netherlands...  Drugs  have  been  legal  for  a  quite  a  while  now  and  results  have  been  nothing  but  successful.  Oh  and  if  you  want  a  more  American  example...  look  at  alcohol  prohibition...	0
Never  legalize.  Legalizing  does  not  solve  the  problem  but  indeed  makes  the  problem  worse,  end  of  story.	1
I  will  argue  first  from  a  practical  position,  then  philosophical,  then  historical.    Marijuana  is  not  dangerous.  There  has  been  a  death  recorded  due  to  marijuana.  The  LD50  or  amount  that  it  would  take  to  kill  half  the  population  is  incredibly  high.  Far  higher.  You  can  reasonably  say  it  is  so  high,  it  is  impossible  to  die  from  overdosing  on  marijuana.  Also  marijuana  does  not  make  you  stupid.  The  reason  people  think  this,  is  that  there  was  a  study  done  on  monkey  where  they  let  them  breathe  only  marijuana  smoke  and  they  died  from  hypoxia  or  lack  of  oxygen.  When  you  die  from  a  lack  of  oxygen,  your  brain  cells  die.  The  severe  errors  in  the  study,  however,  were  released  much  later  than  the  results  so  there  is  now  a  stigma  that  marijuana  use  makes  you  stupid.  They  have  found  that  smoking  marijuana  does  not  cause  cancer  like  cigarette  smoke.  A  UCLA  study  found  no  link.  The  gateway  drug  theory  is  actually  perpetuated  by  the  prohibition  of  marijuana.  Because  marijuana  users  must  get  pot  from  drug  dealers,  they  are  exposed  to  harder,  dangerous  drugs.  If  marijuana  was  able  to  be  sold  in  stores,  this  would  not  happen.  Legalizing  marijuana  would  not  lead  to  an  increase  in  use  by  children.  According  to  many  studies,  it  is  vastly  easier  for  teenagers  to  get  marijuana  than  it  is  for  them  them  to  get  alcohol.  This  is  because  alcohol  must  be  purchased  through  legal  channels  where  vendors  check  for  IDs.  However,  because  of  the  black  market  for  marijuana  drug  dealers  do  not  care  how  old  someone  is  when  they  sell  them  pot.  The  legalization  of  marijuana  will  be  very  good  for  the  economy.  We  spend  billions  of  dollars  each  year  to  keep  people  in  prison  because  they  like  to  get  high  and  relax.  Additionally  marijuana  is  a  huge  cash  crop  the  government  could  make  a  lot  of  money  off  from  taxation.  It  is  the  number  one  cash  crop  in  California  for  example.  ~60%  of  the  money  of  Mexican  drug  cartels  is  earned  by  selling  marijuana  in  the  US.  Severely  compromising  their  funding  would  reduce  crime  in  the  United  States  as  well  as  Mexico,  which  would  help  improve  Mexico's  living  conditions  and  curb  illegal  immigration  into  the  United  States.    The  government  should  not  have  a  right  to  prohibit  you  from  doing  something  to  yourself  that  does  not  harm  anyone  else.  It  is  not  illegal  to  go  home  and  drink  a  gallon  of  paint  thinner,  but  I  guarantee  that  it's  much  better  for  both  you  and  society  that  you  smoke  marijuana  instead  of  drinking  paint  thinner.  Here's  a  more  reasonable  example:  Should  the  government  make  it  illegal  to  consume  significantly  more  calories  than  you  expend?  This  is  much  more  harmful  than  marijuana,  and  obesity  related  illnesses  are  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death.  The  bottom  line  is  that  this  type  of  reasoning  that  the  government  needs  to  be  able  to  protect  you  from  yourself  is  dangerously  close  to  fascism.  Where  do  you  draw  the  line?  Do  we  monitor  people's  jobs  and  make  it  illegal  to  not  work  hard  to  make  sure  people  are  productive  and  that  they  get  promoted?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  be  late  for  job  interviews  because  that  is  bad  for  you?  Do  we  make  it  illegal  to  sleep  in  beds  instead  of  on  the  floor  because  people  have  died  this  way  and  no  one  has  ever  died  from  marijuana?  The  answer  is  no.  Adults  are  free  to  make  their  own  decisions  that  only  affect  themselves.  We  do  not  live  in  a  "nanny-state"  as  Ron  Paul  puts  it.    Many  people  assume  that  because  marijuana  is  illegal  serious  research  and  thinking  went  into  the  decision  to  ban  it.  This  simply  isn't  true.  The  first  marijuana  laws  in  the  United  States  forced  people  to  grow  marijuana  during  colonial  times.  Marijuana  became  illegal  for  a  few  reasons.  One  was  due  to  extreme  anti-Latino  and  anti-black  sentiment.  People  were  fear  mongered  into  believing  that  minorities  were  a  danger  to  white  society  especially  due  to  marijuana.  The  "reefer  madness"  campaign  created  undue  hysteria.  Yellow  journalism  and  personal  career  advancement  also  played  a  role.  In  fact  President  Nixon  commissioned  a  report  on  marijuana  which  concluded  that  marijuana  should  not  be  illegal.    http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/  Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm        The  next  logical  question  is  why  is  marijuana  still  illegal.  Again  there  are  a  few  reasons.  What  kept  it  illegal  during  the  middle  and  late  1900s  was  again  a  fear  mongering  campaign  linking  marijuana  use  and  communism.  By  this  point  in  history  there  is  so  much  social  stigma  against  marijuana,  that  if  you  ask  someone  against  legalization  why  it  should  be  illegal,  they  will  most  likely  cite  things  that  simply  aren't  true.  Additionally  the  alcohol  and  tobacco  industries  are  absolutely  huge.  Companies  in  those  industries  make  a  so  much  money  that  they  can  spend  vast  amounts  lobbying  congress  to  keep  marijuana  illegal.  They  don't  want  competition.  Why  would  you  drink  or  smoke  tobacco  when  they  are  incredibly  dangerous  and  addictive  when  you  can  smoke  marijuana  which  is  harmless  and  not  addictive?  Many  people  underestimate  the  effect  that  a  large  lobby  can  have  on  national  and  state  policy.  The  alcohol  and  tobacco  companies  also  perpetuate  the  social  stigma  against  marijuana  by  funding  anti-drug  and  anti-marijuana  advertisements  and  programs.  The  goal  of  these  programs  is  not  to  make  you  not  do  drugs,  its  to  stop  you  from  doing  drugs  that  they  don't  sell  you.  Also  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes  is  a  huge  threat  to  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  The  pharmaceutical  industry  is  the  biggest  industry  in  the  United  States.  Just  like  the  tobacco  and  alcohol  companies,  pharmaceutical  companies  spend  millions  of  dollars  lobbying  congress.  Marijuana  has  been  some  doctors  as  the  single  best  drug  for  maintaining  health.  It  combats  an  astonishing  number  of  diseases  and  conditions,  and  has  no  side  effects.  Compare  that  to  the  multitude  of  side  effects  from  prescription  drugs.  It  has  become  a  cliche  how  at  the  end  of  television  commercials  for  prescription  drugs  they  rattle  off  a  long  list  of  some  pretty  serious  side  effects.  Thousands  of  people  die  from  adverse  reactions  to  prescription  drugs.    As  I  hope  you  can  see,  the  prohibition  of  marijuana  is  completely  wrong  on  many  levels.  Making  marijuana  legal  will  keep  it  away  from  kids,  keep  people  away  from  dangerous  hard  drugs,  and  allow  adults  to  make  their  own  choices  when  it  comes  to  their  own  lives.[SEP]you  are  a  fuckin  genious,  you  should  get  a  nobile  prize  for  writing  this,  man  oh  man.  especially  i  liked  the  part  where  you  say  marijuana  is  not  dangerous,  its  like  saying  driving  a  tank  in  the  middle  of  the  street  while  you  are  drunk  and  there  are  little  kinds  around  you,  is  not  dangerous.  man,  you  are  a  fuckin  genius.  NOT  DAngerOus,  rlmao,  my  ass  is  not  dangerous,  marijuana  is.  it  is  weapon,  a  drug,  it  is  like  a  bullet,  uncontrolable.	1
Never  legalize.  Legalizing  does  not  solve  the  problem  but  indeed  makes  the  problem  worse,  end  of  story.[SEP]This  is  not  the  first  time  that  drugs  have  been  illegal,  and  it  will  not  be  the  first  time  that  the  have  been  legalized.  Consider  the  18th  and  21st  amendments,  which  prohibited  and  legalized  alcohol,  respectively.  The  18th  amendment  caused  the  rise  of  organized  crime,  and  thousands  of  people  died  from  drinking  wood  alcohol.  With  the  21st  amendment,  much  of  that  went  away.    Something  similar  will  probably  happen  with  Cannabis  and  other  drugs.  Once  they  can  be  regulated  by  the  FDA  and  sold  in  reputable  stores,  the  amount  of  crime  will  go  down  and  quality  will  go  up.	0

Ok,  let  me  educate  you  peple,  and  set  the  facts  straight  on  Cannabis.    1st,  Cannabis  is  probably  the  safest  drug  known  to  man,  we  have  a  endocannabinoid  system  designed  to  handle  the  substance.  -    http://www.briancbennett.com/charts/death/cannabis.htm      2nd,  medically  speaking  it  is  one  of  the  safest  and  most  effective  medications  for  the  widest  variety  diseases  known.  -    http://scientificfactsofpot.com/studies.htm      3rd,  more  people  die  from  the  war  on  drugs  than  they  die  from  the  pot  itself,  i  need  no  citation  here  if  you  believe  that  this  plant  has  killed  more  than  the  cartels,  (a  result  of  this  underground  black  market  that  formed  to  fill  the  demand  for  cannabis)  and  this  war  on  drugs  has,  then  then  you're  beyond  help.    4th,  the  government  understands  that  there  are  no  negative  effects  of  pot  use,  otherwise  they'd  be  all  over  it  parading  the  facts  on  their  asinine  antidrug  commercials.    5th,  as  far  as  the  commercials  go  they're  run  by  the  NIDA  (national  institute  on  drug  abuse)  which  is  able  to  run  such  a  heavy  ad  campaign  because  of  contributions  from  the  alcohol  and  tobacco  industry..  -    http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/obstruction.htm      6th,  In  a  recent  study  it  was  shown  that  cannabis  actually  DISCOURAGES  harder  drug  use.  -  (simple  version)    http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/medicalmj08.htm#note1      -  (for  the  scientifically  inclined)    http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/4/1/16      7th,  cannabis  prohibition  was  created  as  a  way  to  arrest  jazz  musicians  and  mexican  immigrants  taking  american  jobs  -  even  the  history  channel  knows  this,  just  look  at  their  doc  on  it    8th,  we're  alienating  our  kids  and  workers,  creating  a  network  of  fear  through  these  ineffective  drug  tests  -    http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/drugtest.htm      9th,  the  tax  revenue  from  legalization  is  estimated  to  be  in  the  billions  -    http://economics.about.com/od/incometaxestaxcuts/a/legalize_pot.htm      10th,  through  legalization  we'd  be  restoring  the  fundamental  RIGHT  of  people  to  do  as  they  please  with  their  bodies.  The  government  has  no  say  in  what  someone  should  do  with  their  body  as  long  as  it's  not  infringing  on  anyone  else's  rights.    as  far  as  driving  high  goes  -    http://www.break.com/usercontent/2007/7/                                                                                Dr...igh-339007.html	0
Popular  sovreignity  is  the  cornerstone  of  democracy.  Purely  on  the  grounds  of  this,  the  overwhelming  public  support  for  the  legalisation  of  marijuana,  should  it  be  legalised.  A  question  of  legality  should  be  totally  devoid  of  any  of  the  the  potential  benefits  or  problems  since  our  political  system  is  not  based  upon  paternal  justifications.    This  aside,  the  overwhelming  benefits  to  society  is  enough  even  for  a  clearly  paternal  government  to  legalise.  Even  though  these  have  already  been  stated,  I  will  reiterate:  the  economic  savings  of  such  legalisation  alongside  the  proven  fall  in  consumption  (note  statistics  from  Portugal's  decriminalisation)  provides  a  clear  justification  if  this  government  did  have  our  best  interests  at  heart.	0
yes  it  whould  be  legalized  beacause  ive  grown  up  around  people  who  have  smoked  pot  or  are  smoking  pot  and  it  never  made  them  hullucinate  or  slow  down  there  motor  functions  in  fact  its  actully  help  a  few  of  them.  besides  why  is  it  the  hospitals  can  give  it  out  to  people  with  cancer  when  ever  one  else  gets  arrested  just  because  they  have  a  few  tumors  that  gives  them  the  right  to  bypass  the  law  that  every  one  has  to  obay.	0

Cancer  patients  are  prescribed  because  it  takes  away  the  nausea  that  follow  chemotherapy  sessions  which  is  extremely  important  to  the  recovery  of  the  patient  since  if  said  patient  can't  eat  from  the  chemo  he'll  stay  weak  and  probably  not  survive.  It's  not  because  they  are  dying  to  ease  the  pain.  Pot  isn't  that  hardcore  man.	0
Effectiveness  of  the  War  On  Drugs:    "Police  arrested  an  estimated  872,720  persons  for  cannabis  violations  in  2007,  the  highest  annual  total  ever  recorded  in  the  United  States,  according  to  statistics  compiled  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation.  Of  those  charged  with  cannabis  violations,  approximately  89  percent,  775,137  Americans  were  charged  with  possession  only.  An  American  is  now  arrested  for  violating  cannabis  laws  every  38  seconds.  "    -Obviously,  from  this  you  can  see  that  it's  completely  failing:  the  American  people  want  to  smoke  pot  and  there's  nothing  that  can  be  done  about  it.    Cost:    "Since  December  31,  1995,  the  U.S.  prison  population  has  grown  an  average  of  43,266  inmates  per  year.  About  25  per  cent  are  sentenced  for  drug  law  violations.  "  -Many  of  these  people's  lives  were  completely  ruined  by  incarceration.    "The  U.S.  federal  government  spent  over  $19  billion  dollars  in  2003  on  the  War  on  Drugs,  at  a  rate  of  about  $600  per  second.  The  budget  has  since  been  increased  by  over  a  billion  dollars.  "  -  All  these  tax  dollars  spent  in  attempt  to  prevent  something  that's  never  going  away  and  millions  of  hard  working  American  citizens  enjoy.    So  the  war  on  drugs  is  completely  un-effective  and  also  extremely  costly  in  terms  of  human  life,  happiness,  and  finances.  All  quotes  taken  from    http://www.drugsense.org/wodclock.htm    which  has  further  references.    Also,  read  the  government's  findings  on  marijuana  here:    http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/  marijuana.html        Keep  in  mind  most  of  everything  that  is  said  in  this  report  uses  words  such  as  "may"  and  "could"  because  nothing,  as  of  now,  is  conclusive.  This  is  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  we  as  humans  have  been  using  it  for  thousands  of  years.  My  feeling  on  this  is  that  if  marijuana  actually  is  dangerous....then  not  only  would  we  know  it  from  hearing  about  it,  but  these  studies  would  have  conclusive,  definitive  results.  Not  wishy-washy,  half-assed  results.  Also:  you  won't  find  anything  in  that  report  that  is  worse  than  existing  legal  substances  and  pharmacueticals  (think  vicoden,  lithium,  valuum,  morphein,  wel  butron,  etc.).    So...what  the  hell?  Why  are  we  having  a  war  on  pot?      Results  of  ending  the  war  on  drugs:  no  more  tax  money  being  spent,  millions  of  Americans'  lives  will  be  instantly  better  as  they  will  not  be  incarcerated,  etc.  A  new  industry  will  be  created  that  will  provide  tax  revenue,  jobs,  etc.  A  small  number  (comparatively)  of  government  workers  would  lose  their  jobs.    Results  of  not  ending  the  war  on  drugs:  DEA  agents,  etc.  and  others  will  not  lose  their  jobs.  Politicians  will  continue  to  have  something  to  be  proud  of  and  market  themselves  with.  People  will  continue  to  use  drugs  anyway,  as  history  has  shown  and  nothing  will  change  as  it  is  now  and  has  been  since  it  was  made  illegal.    An  alternative  to  the  war  on  drugs?  We  need  to  shift  our  thinking  from  drug  addict,  CRIMINALS  to  drug  addict,  PATIENTS.  Meaning  these  people  need  help,  not  jail.  There's  a  reason  they  are  taking  the  drug  -  lets  solve  the  problem  with  using  therapy,  clinics,  raising  awareness,  and  educating  people  so  that  they  can  make  their  own  healthy  decisions.  No  one  is  saying  there  isn't  a  problem,  but  there  are  many  that  say  (and  I  agree)  that  we're  going  about  this  problem  all  wrong.	0
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.[SEP]Well,  yes,  people  still  do  those  things.  Don't  people  still  murder  other  people?  Don't  people  still  embezzle  money?  All  this  still  happens,  but  because  it  is  illegal,  it  takes  place  less  often.  Don't  people  still  sell  marijuana  and  don't  people  still  smoke  it?  Yes,  they  do.  It's  just  much  more  dangerous  and  expensive  to  do  so  because  it's  illegal.    I  believe  the  core  of  our  disagreement  here  seems  to  be  that  we  have  opposing  viewpoints  on  marijuana  alone,  whereas  you  seem  to  think  of  it  as  something  bad;  some  kind  of  scourge  of  society.  I  don't  see  it  that  way.  There  has  been  endless  debate  over  whether  or  not  marijuana  is  harmful,  and  I  choose  to  believe  it's  really  not  that  bad.  Either  way,  it  should  be  a  level-minded  individual's  choice  to  smoke  marijuana,  just  like  it's  their  choice  if  they  wish  to  smoke  cigarettes  or  drink  alcohol,  both  very  destructive  substances,  yet  still  legal.  My  core  belief  is  that  it  should  be  the  individual's  choice  whether  to  do  something  or  not.    Although  there  is  some  small  chance  that  you  are    not    calling  me  a  pothead,  let's  get  something  straight;  I've  never  smoked  marijuana,  I've  never  done  any  other  drug,  I  don't  drink  alcohol,  I  don't  smoke  cigarettes,  and  to  be  honest,  I  really  don't  plan  on  doing  any  of  the  above.  I've  made  it  thus  far  without  them,  and  I  don't  have  any  real  reason  to  start  now.  So,  because  of  this,  I  can  say  that  I  have  reasoning  beyond  what  is  simply  personally  more  convenient.      The  war  on  marijuana,  not  all  drugs,  but  marijuana,  sucks  up    so  much    federal,  state,  and  local  money.  Couldn't  this  money  be  better  spent  enforcing  the  other  laws,  say,  the  ones  that  keep  people  under  the  influence  off  the  roads?  Or  maybe  we  could  put  this  money  towards  something  we  can  all  enjoy,  like  lowering  taxes.  There  are  just  better  ways  to  spend  our  money.    You  make  good  points,  and  I  understand  what  you  are  getting  at,  I  just  wholeheartedly  disagree.	0

im  not  for  legalizing  it,  but  all  i'm  saying  is  that  if  we  took  all  the  money  that  we  put  into  the  war  on  drugs  and  had  it  back,  we  could  buy  all  the  weed  farms  in  the  world  and  eradicate  the  substance.  same  with  cocaine.[SEP]Interesting  point.

Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.[SEP]Well,  yes,  people  still  do  those  things.  Don't  people  still  murder  other  people?  Don't  people  still  embezzle  money?  All  this  still  happens,  but  because  it  is  illegal,  it  takes  place  less  often.  Don't  people  still  sell  marijuana  and  don't  people  still  smoke  it?  Yes,  they  do.  It's  just  much  more  dangerous  and  expensive  to  do  so  because  it's  illegal.    I  believe  the  core  of  our  disagreement  here  seems  to  be  that  we  have  opposing  viewpoints  on  marijuana  alone,  whereas  you  seem  to  think  of  it  as  something  bad;  some  kind  of  scourge  of  society.  I  don't  see  it  that  way.  There  has  been  endless  debate  over  whether  or  not  marijuana  is  harmful,  and  I  choose  to  believe  it's  really  not  that  bad.  Either  way,  it  should  be  a  level-minded  individual's  choice  to  smoke  marijuana,  just  like  it's  their  choice  if  they  wish  to  smoke  cigarettes  or  drink  alcohol,  both  very  destructive  substances,  yet  still  legal.  My  core  belief  is  that  it  should  be  the  individual's  choice  whether  to  do  something  or  not.    Although  there  is  some  small  chance  that  you  are    not    calling  me  a  pothead,  let's  get  something  straight;  I've  never  smoked  marijuana,  I've  never  done  any  other  drug,  I  don't  drink  alcohol,  I  don't  smoke  cigarettes,  and  to  be  honest,  I  really  don't  plan  on  doing  any  of  the  above.  I've  made  it  thus  far  without  them,  and  I  don't  have  any  real  reason  to  start  now.  So,  because  of  this,  I  can  say  that  I  have  reasoning  beyond  what  is  simply  personally  more  convenient.      The  war  on  marijuana,  not  all  drugs,  but  marijuana,  sucks  up    so  much    federal,  state,  and  local  money.  Couldn't  this  money  be  better  spent  enforcing  the  other  laws,  say,  the  ones  that  keep  people  under  the  influence  off  the  roads?  Or  maybe  we  could  put  this  money  towards  something  we  can  all  enjoy,  like  lowering  taxes.  There  are  just  better  ways  to  spend  our  money.    You  make  good  points,  and  I  understand  what  you  are  getting  at,  I  just  wholeheartedly  disagree.[SEP]Ok  that  is  fine,  good  explanations.  But  if  they  legalize  weed  and  see  how  much  of  a  problem  it  becomes  then  make  it  illegal  again,  it  will  only  make  things  worse.  Remember  prohibition?  I've  never  done  any  drugs  myself,  sure  I've  drank  my  share  of  alcohol  and  I'm  not  even  of  age  to  do  so,  but  I'm  not  a  drunk.  And  I  wasn't  calling  you  a  pothead,  I  was  saying  it  in  general.  I  just  feel  it'll  cause  more  problems  in  the  long  run  with  people  becoming  "addicted"  to  it  and  needing  help  to  get  off  of  it.  And  as  far  as  it  goes  for  medicinal  purposes,  marijuana  does  not  cure  anything  in  which  many  people  try  and  use  that  excuse  because  they  think  it  does.  It  is  for  the  sole  purpose  of  numbing  the  pain  in  cancer  patients  in  which  they  can  switch  to  other  alternatives  and  also  making  patients  hungry  so  they  eat  more  and  gain  weight  on  their  sick  bodies.	1

I  don't  like  drugs,  and  I'd  rather  they  didn't  exist,  period.  But  that's  not  the  case.  On  the  argument  of  prison  overcrowding  due  to  illegal  drug  users,  they  may  as  well  legalize  it  and  reduce  the  crowding.  However,  legalizing  it  will  give  too  much  leeway  for  people  to  get  their  hands  on  it  even  more.  It's  overall  bad  for  society,  but  whether  it's  legal  or  illegal,  it  has  its  upsides  and  downsides  alike.  On  the  other  hand,  I'm  absolutely  not  looking  forward  to  smelling  marijuana  everywhere  I  go,  that  is,  if  it  was  legalized.  It  is  so  awful  and  obvious  smelling.	0

Yes.  Smoking  pot  may  not  be  a  good  idea,  but  it's  no  more  harmful  than  alcohol  or  cigarettes,  and  does  not  harm  anyone  who  doesn't  choose  to  take  it  up.  Especially  with  our  current  budget  restrictions,  we  can't  afford  to  save  people  from  their  own  stupid  decisions.	0

YES.....weed  is  the  way  to  go......It  would  be  AWSOME  if  weed  was  legal////////[SEP]Yes,  because  then  mandatory  sentencing  would  be  stopped,  and  young  lives  could  be  saved  from  insane  jail  sentences.	0
I  really  hate  drugs,  but  honestly,  I'm  tired  of  waging  war  on  high  dealers  and  hobos  and  kids  who  cave  in  to  peer  pressure.  The  prison  ruins  their  lives  and  we're  wasting  so  much  money  by  doing  this.	0

Really  all  making  it  illegal  does  it  raises  the  black  market  price.  So  the  beneficiaries  are  drug  dealers  and  money  laundering  bankers.    Its  tragic  because  mandatory  sentences  are  so  excessive  they  ruin  young  peoples  lives  with  long  jail  times.  This  is  inexcusable.  It  should  never  have  been  made  illegal  in  the  first  place.	0
I  cant  believe  I  am  saying  "legalize",  cause  every  time  the  pothead  in  the  flat  below  mine  starts  smoking  it,  the  whole  block  of  flats  starts  stinking  of  skunk.    Part  of  me  thinks  that  it  should  remain  illegal  so  people  can  call  the  police  and  arrest  the  inconsiderate  idiot...  but  after  a  bit  of  thought,  I  have  changed  my  mind.    If  it  was  legalized,  then  pot  would  probably  be  of  better  quality,  and  closely  monitored  for  its  ingredients.      If  it  was  legalized,  and  you  could  only  get  it  from  your  doctor,  then  it  would  be  easy  to  detect  addiction  and  the  doctor  could  refuse  to  give  you  any.      If  it  was  legalized,  then  there  would  be  no  dodgy  characters  entering  my  block  of  flats  to  sell  not  only  pot  but  the  whole  array  of  harder  drugs.    If  it  was  legalized,  some  of  the  money  that  pothead  is  paying  could  be  used  to  benefit  the  rest  of  us  in  taxes,  and  not  only  a  small  group  of  criminal  barons.      But,  alas,  it  is  illegal...  so  now  I  have  to  put  up  with  skunk  smell  and  shadows  creeping  in  the  night  to  sell  it.	0

That's  fine  with  me.  It  should  be  legalized,  that  way  people  don't  have  to  go  behind  the  law  to  do  it,  which  brings  up  all  kinds  of  problems.  So,  ya  i  agree.	0
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.[SEP]Well,  yes,  people  still  do  those  things.  Don't  people  still  murder  other  people?  Don't  people  still  embezzle  money?  All  this  still  happens,  but  because  it  is  illegal,  it  takes  place  less  often.  Don't  people  still  sell  marijuana  and  don't  people  still  smoke  it?  Yes,  they  do.  It's  just  much  more  dangerous  and  expensive  to  do  so  because  it's  illegal.    I  believe  the  core  of  our  disagreement  here  seems  to  be  that  we  have  opposing  viewpoints  on  marijuana  alone,  whereas  you  seem  to  think  of  it  as  something  bad;  some  kind  of  scourge  of  society.  I  don't  see  it  that  way.  There  has  been  endless  debate  over  whether  or  not  marijuana  is  harmful,  and  I  choose  to  believe  it's  really  not  that  bad.  Either  way,  it  should  be  a  level-minded  individual's  choice  to  smoke  marijuana,  just  like  it's  their  choice  if  they  wish  to  smoke  cigarettes  or  drink  alcohol,  both  very  destructive  substances,  yet  still  legal.  My  core  belief  is  that  it  should  be  the  individual's  choice  whether  to  do  something  or  not.    Although  there  is  some  small  chance  that  you  are    not    calling  me  a  pothead,  let's  get  something  straight;  I've  never  smoked  marijuana,  I've  never  done  any  other  drug,  I  don't  drink  alcohol,  I  don't  smoke  cigarettes,  and  to  be  honest,  I  really  don't  plan  on  doing  any  of  the  above.  I've  made  it  thus  far  without  them,  and  I  don't  have  any  real  reason  to  start  now.  So,  because  of  this,  I  can  say  that  I  have  reasoning  beyond  what  is  simply  personally  more  convenient.      The  war  on  marijuana,  not  all  drugs,  but  marijuana,  sucks  up    so  much    federal,  state,  and  local  money.  Couldn't  this  money  be  better  spent  enforcing  the  other  laws,  say,  the  ones  that  keep  people  under  the  influence  off  the  roads?  Or  maybe  we  could  put  this  money  towards  something  we  can  all  enjoy,  like  lowering  taxes.  There  are  just  better  ways  to  spend  our  money.    You  make  good  points,  and  I  understand  what  you  are  getting  at,  I  just  wholeheartedly  disagree.[SEP]Ok  that  is  fine,  good  explanations.  But  if  they  legalize  weed  and  see  how  much  of  a  problem  it  becomes  then  make  it  illegal  again,  it  will  only  make  things  worse.  Remember  prohibition?  I've  never  done  any  drugs  myself,  sure  I've  drank  my  share  of  alcohol  and  I'm  not  even  of  age  to  do  so,  but  I'm  not  a  drunk.  And  I  wasn't  calling  you  a  pothead,  I  was  saying  it  in  general.  I  just  feel  it'll  cause  more  problems  in  the  long  run  with  people  becoming  "addicted"  to  it  and  needing  help  to  get  off  of  it.  And  as  far  as  it  goes  for  medicinal  purposes,  marijuana  does  not  cure  anything  in  which  many  people  try  and  use  that  excuse  because  they  think  it  does.  It  is  for  the  sole  purpose  of  numbing  the  pain  in  cancer  patients  in  which  they  can  switch  to  other  alternatives  and  also  making  patients  hungry  so  they  eat  more  and  gain  weight  on  their  sick  bodies.[SEP]People  don't  use  Marijuana  to    cure    anything,  just  in  the  same  way  we  don't  use  Aspirin  or  any  other  painkiller,  or  most  medicines,  to  cure  anything,  as  most  medicines  are  used  to  treat  the  symptoms  until  the  ailment  goes  away,  or,  if  it  never  does,  to  make  life  a  bit  more  bearable.      Prohibition  didn't  work  for  a  reason.  People  don't  take  too  well  to  getting  their  freedoms  taken  away.  Alcohol  was  part  of  the  national  culture.  While  marijuana  is  not  part  of  our  national  culture,  we  would  still  be  better  off  making  it  legal.[SEP]Eh,  I  think  it's  a  huge  part  of  our  culture.  But  that's  a  debate  for  another  day...    Everything  else  is  on  point.  :)	0
one  major  point:    canada-  they  have  legalized  pot,  and  more  guns,  and  lower  murder  rate.  bc  all  those  guns  are  chill.	0
weed  should  be  legal.    it's  the  safest  "drug"  there  is  and  it's  ridiculous  that  alcohol  and  cigarettes  are  legal  and  killing  people  while  marijuana  is  illegal  and  hasn't  killed  anyone.    plus  it  doesn't  have  any  serious  side  effects,  just  makes  you  more  relaxed  and  sometimes  you  think  about  things  that  never  cross  your  mind  while  sober.  i  think  the  government  has  no  right  to  dictate  the  way  we  live  our  life  and  what  we  do  in  our  spare  time  as  long  as  we're  not  hurting  others  or  vandalizing  property.    there's  many  other  reasons  why  i  think  it  should  be  legal,  this  is  just  a  few  of  them.	0

And  hemp  could  be  used  for  so  many  things,  even  to  make  clothes.  There  is  no  need  to  import  for  hemp  production.  USA  used  to  be  a  producer  of  it  for  ropes  and  stuff.  It  should  never  have  been  made  illegal.	0
The  government  could  make  so  much  money  if  they  just  make  it  legal.  First,  they  won't  have  to  spend  a  lot  of  money  trying  to  stop  it.  Trying  to  stop  it  this  way  is  obviously  not  working.  Second,  the  U.S.  could  make  marijuana  just  another  commodity.  They  could  tax  the  use  or  the  purchase  of  marijuana  and  actually  make  money.      However,  it's  probably  in  the  best  interest  for  the  whole  country  if  smoking  pot  in  public  is  banned.  Doing  it  at  home  is  still  the  same  as  doing  it  outside.	0

But  I  probably  wouldn't  want  to  tax  it.  At  least  not  much.  Cuz  then  how  are  people  gonna  afford  snacks  for  the  munchies  right?  But  seriously,  taxation  is  good  to  convince  govt  to  legalize  it,  although  its  actually  onerous  to  add  more  taxes,  so  if  it  is  done,  it  should  be  done  as  little  as  possible.	0
yes  .  the  war  is  just  retarded  .  and  if  weed  is  legal  the  economy  would  be  better  ,  and  alot  more  people  would  not  die  for  two  reasons  the  war  and  a  drug  deal  gone  bad  my  friend  was  shot  and  almost  l  killed  in  a  drug  deal  gone  bad	0

even  though  i  am  not  a  user  i  still  believe  that  pot  should  be  leagalized.  not  only  will  it  help  bring  it  us  out  of  our  major  debt  but  will  stop  violence  over  drugs.  we  shouldnt  put  people  in  jail  for  smokin  pot  when  we  have  murderers  all  over  the  country.

If  you  look  at  the  history  on  how  it  got  classified  as  a  hardcore  substance  it  all  politically  motivated  and  a  bunch  of  BS.  Marijuana  has  so  many  benefits  for  sick  people  and  also  it's  building  material  which  is  grows  in  only  a  few  months.

You  know  me  I  don't  smoke  it  but  I  think  that  it's  all  about  personal  freedoms  who's  right  is  it  to  tell  you  what  you  put  in  your  body.  The  other  drugs  such  as  cocaine  and  heroin  those  need  to  stay  as  such.	0
i  think  it  would  be  a  perfect  thing  for  the  Gov't  if  legel.  Pot  heads  would  still  buy  it  for  any  price  and  it  would  help  lower  our  debt.  But  if  it  were  leaglized  it  would  need  to  be  controlled  and  stuff.  its  still  dangroud  and  adictive  like  beer  and  cigrattes	0
Yes  pot  heads  help  the  economy  by  eating  chips  and  going  to  7  eleven  for  slur-pees.  Stop  building  jail  cells  for  people  who  like  pot.  It's  about  time  they  loosen  up.	0
Legalize  it  tax  it,  it  could  be  the  answer  for  our  debt  crisis.	0
Legalize  it  tax  it,  it  could  be  the  answer  for  our  debt  crisis.[SEP]Legalizing  it  is  morally  and  economically  right,  but  estimates  put  revenue  only  at  $10-15  billion  dollars  and  the  deficit  of  2009  is  1.4  trillion  and  the  debt  is  12.4  trillion.  It  would  help.	0
The  amount  of  money  that  the  feds  post  fighting  the  war  on  drugs  is  nothing  compared  to  what  they  would  gain  if  they  legalized,  taxed,  and  regulated  it.	0
Although  i  am  not  a  pot  smoker  I  do  believe  that  pot  should  be  legalized  for  many  reasons.  For  one  pot  was  never  a  direct  cause  of  death  to  anyone  unlike  tobacco  and  beer.  Pot  is  also  one  of  the  most  high  priced  exports  of  Central  American  Countries  and  the  Carribean.  Legalizing  pot  can  help  save  our  economy  if  we  make  it  one  of  the  major  exports  of  America.  Also  a  lot  of  comedians  like  to  take  their  ideas  from  pot  too  haha	0
let  me  tell  you  guys  somthing  ciggerates  kill  you  drugs  give  you  a  nice  fell	0
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.[SEP]Well,  yes,  people  still  do  those  things.  Don't  people  still  murder  other  people?  Don't  people  still  embezzle  money?  All  this  still  happens,  but  because  it  is  illegal,  it  takes  place  less  often.  Don't  people  still  sell  marijuana  and  don't  people  still  smoke  it?  Yes,  they  do.  It's  just  much  more  dangerous  and  expensive  to  do  so  because  it's  illegal.    I  believe  the  core  of  our  disagreement  here  seems  to  be  that  we  have  opposing  viewpoints  on  marijuana  alone,  whereas  you  seem  to  think  of  it  as  something  bad;  some  kind  of  scourge  of  society.  I  don't  see  it  that  way.  There  has  been  endless  debate  over  whether  or  not  marijuana  is  harmful,  and  I  choose  to  believe  it's  really  not  that  bad.  Either  way,  it  should  be  a  level-minded  individual's  choice  to  smoke  marijuana,  just  like  it's  their  choice  if  they  wish  to  smoke  cigarettes  or  drink  alcohol,  both  very  destructive  substances,  yet  still  legal.  My  core  belief  is  that  it  should  be  the  individual's  choice  whether  to  do  something  or  not.    Although  there  is  some  small  chance  that  you  are    not    calling  me  a  pothead,  let's  get  something  straight;  I've  never  smoked  marijuana,  I've  never  done  any  other  drug,  I  don't  drink  alcohol,  I  don't  smoke  cigarettes,  and  to  be  honest,  I  really  don't  plan  on  doing  any  of  the  above.  I've  made  it  thus  far  without  them,  and  I  don't  have  any  real  reason  to  start  now.  So,  because  of  this,  I  can  say  that  I  have  reasoning  beyond  what  is  simply  personally  more  convenient.      The  war  on  marijuana,  not  all  drugs,  but  marijuana,  sucks  up    so  much    federal,  state,  and  local  money.  Couldn't  this  money  be  better  spent  enforcing  the  other  laws,  say,  the  ones  that  keep  people  under  the  influence  off  the  roads?  Or  maybe  we  could  put  this  money  towards  something  we  can  all  enjoy,  like  lowering  taxes.  There  are  just  better  ways  to  spend  our  money.    You  make  good  points,  and  I  understand  what  you  are  getting  at,  I  just  wholeheartedly  disagree.[SEP]Ok  that  is  fine,  good  explanations.  But  if  they  legalize  weed  and  see  how  much  of  a  problem  it  becomes  then  make  it  illegal  again,  it  will  only  make  things  worse.  Remember  prohibition?  I've  never  done  any  drugs  myself,  sure  I've  drank  my  share  of  alcohol  and  I'm  not  even  of  age  to  do  so,  but  I'm  not  a  drunk.  And  I  wasn't  calling  you  a  pothead,  I  was  saying  it  in  general.  I  just  feel  it'll  cause  more  problems  in  the  long  run  with  people  becoming  "addicted"  to  it  and  needing  help  to  get  off  of  it.  And  as  far  as  it  goes  for  medicinal  purposes,  marijuana  does  not  cure  anything  in  which  many  people  try  and  use  that  excuse  because  they  think  it  does.  It  is  for  the  sole  purpose  of  numbing  the  pain  in  cancer  patients  in  which  they  can  switch  to  other  alternatives  and  also  making  patients  hungry  so  they  eat  more  and  gain  weight  on  their  sick  bodies.[SEP]First,  you  have  done  drugs  yourself,  because  alcohol  IS  a  drug.  It's  simply  a  legal  one  like  tobacco.  And  as  someone  who  has  been  around  both  and  tried  both  and  tried  both  in  excess,  it's  my  opinion  that  alcohol  is  a  far  more  dangerous  drug  than  marijuana.      Marijuana  does  inflict  harm  to  the  self,  but  that's  where  it  ends.  People  don't  get  high  and  then  get  belligerent,  angry,  and  violent.  They  don't  get  high  and  drive  overconfidently  at  90  mph.  I'm  not  saying  driving  under  the  influence  of  marijuana  is  by  any  means  safe,  but  in  comparison  to  alcohol,  it  is  a  lot  safer.  When  you're  under  the  influence  of  alcohol,  you  become  overconfident  in  your  abilities  and  drive  without  the  normal  care  and  caution  you  would  have.  Your  vision  is  also  blurred  and  reaction  times  slowed.  Under  marijuana,  again  your  reaction  times  are  slowed,  but  unlike  using  alcohol,  when  you  drive  under  the  influence  of  marijuana  you  drive  with  more  care  and  caution  than  normal.  It's  the  positive  effect  of  paranoia.  Furthermore,  you  can  overdose  on  alcohol  and  die  from  it,  which  is  an  impossibility  with  marijuana.      It's  interesting  that  you  bring  up  prohibition  and  then  state  that  you're  afraid  it  will  cause  problems  because  people  will  become  "addicted"  to  it.  Prohibition  is  an  excellent  example  to  bring  up.  What  did  history  teach  us  about  prohibition?  That  it  doesn't  work.  People  will  always  self  medicate,  and  so  long  as  the  substances  they  are  using  are  absent  of  any  serious  effects,  they  will  continue  using  those  substances.      In  fact,  legalization  of  marijuana  may  cut  down  on  the  "gateway"  effect  of  the  drug  (though  I  don't  buy  the  gateway  argument  in  and  of  itself,  but  more  on  that  later).  Many  people  try  marijuana  after  being  taught  by  the  government's  propaganda  what  a  terrible  awful  drug  it  is.  Once  they  try  it  and  learn  the  truth,  that  it's  very  similar  to  alcohol,  with  a  few  key  differences,  they  begin  to  question  the  government's  authority  on  other  drugs  as  well.  "If  they  lied  to  me  about  marijuana,  maybe  cocaine's  not  all  that  bad  either."      On  the  other  hand,  let  me  say  this  to  the  gateway  argument.  Tobacco  and  alcohol  are  the  number  one  and  number  two  gateway  drugs.  So  if  we  call  marijuana  a  gateway,  let  us  only  do  so  after  calling  out  the  top  two.      As  far  as  medicinal  marijuana  goes,  you've  obviously  either  done  little  to  no  research  on  the  topic  or  you  lack  compassion.  You  state  that  cancer  patients  use  it  to  numb  the  pain  of  treatment  and  to  make  them  hungry  in  order  to  counteract  the  effects  of  nausea  from  treatment.  I  ask,  what  is  wrong  with  that?  It  seems  that  if  people  are  going  through  a  very  painful  and  difficult  treatment  (that  may  not  even  succeed)  they  might  be  entitled  to  pain  relief  and  some  semblance  of  a  normal  life  (i.e.  being  able  to  eat  normally).  Nobody  claims  that  marijuana  "cures"  anything,  it's  pain  medication,  much  like  morphine,  demerol,  vicodin,  etc.  AND  it's  natural.  No  pharmaceutical  company  has  mixed  in  chemical  compounds  to  create  it.  I  get  terrible  menstrual  cycles,  they've  always  been  awful  and  have  gotten  worse  as  I've  gotten  a  bit  older.  The  only  thing  that  successfully  treats  the  pain  and  discomfort  I  feel  during  those  first  two  days  is,  you  guessed  it,  marijuana.      Prohibition  has  been  tried...for  seventy  years.  And  rather  than  reduce  marijuana  use,  now  nearly  half  of  the  country  admits  to  having  tried  the  substance.  We  waste  money  on  criminalization  of  marijuana  and  we  create  crime.  If  marijuana  were  available  legally,  drug  dealers  would  be  out  of  business,  and  users  would  no  longer  have  to  be  jailed  at  your  expense.  The  government  would  be  able  to  tax  the  substance  and  make  a  pretty  penny  off  of  people's  use  of  it  as  well.      There's  no  proof  that  use  of  marijuana  would  increase  if  prohibition  ended.  It  would  make  us  all  safer  and  save  us  a  ton  of  money.  I'm  sick  of  the  hypocrisy  of  alcohol-users  in  regards  to  marijuana.  If  you  want  to  oppose  it,  fine,  but  you  sure  as  hell  better  oppose  it's  uglier,  scarier  brother,  Alcohol,  first.	0
The  War  on  Drugs  is  not  only  a  moral  problem  but  a  economic  problem.  First,  it  is  morally  wrong  because  the  government  restricts  the  free  choice  of  individuals  to  participate  in  such  substances,  and  the  number  of  people  people  killed  every  year  with  selling  or  buying  drugs  is  simply  unnecessary  and  unjust.  When  someone  engages  in  the  use  of  drugs,  it  is  the  decision  of  that  person  and  they  are  only  hurting  themselves  nor  the  government.    Second,  economically,  instead  of  enforcing  drug  prohibition  with  $10  billion  of  spending,  the  government  could  control  the  supply  of  drugs  by  legally  selling  the  product  and  taxing  where  estimates  range  in  $10  billion  dollars  as  well.  The  government  would  have  10  billion  dollars  to  spend  elsewhere.  It  would  eliminate  drug  cartels.  Not  only  is  the  enforcement  costly,  but  by  criminalizing  these  people,  taxpayers  have  to  pay  for  them  in  live  in  prisons  throughout  America.    The  only  negative  aspect  is  that  it  may  lead  to  a  increase  in  drug  addicts.	0

Pot  is  by  far  one  of  the  least  harmful  drugs  out  there  and  it  is  probably  more  helpful  than  harmful.  Legalize  it,  regulate  it,  tax  it  and  the  prisons  will  have  room  for  real  criminals.	0
Everywhere  that  drugs  have  been  legalized,  the  decrease  in  their  usage  has  been  phenomenal.  It's  pretty  clear  that  it  should  be  ended,  and  only  the  arrogant  can  deny  that.	0
Yes.  Pot  is  much  safer  than  alcohol  and  tobacco,  and  far  less  addictive  than  many  legal  drugs  (including  coffee!)    Pot  is  also  a  better  substance  to  take  in  a  social  context:  alcohol  can  make  people  aggressive  and  even  violent,  whereas  pot  relaxes  you.	0
1.  why  does  each  side  have  hundreds  of  points,  but  there  are  not  arguements?    2.  I'm  glad  you  brought  up  this  subject.      In  the  history  of  mankind,  prohibition  of  any  substance  that  one  puts  into  their  own  body  has  never  worked.    Alcohol  was  no  more  or  less  popular  during  prohibition,  than  now.  The  only  difference  was  that  instead  of  States  and  the  feds  recieving  tons  of  tax  dollars,  and  the  money  from  alcohol  purchase  going  into  the  hands  of  legitimate  businesses  that  employed  citizens  who  contributed  to  society  and  paid  taxes,    all  the  money  was  going  to  gangsters  and  thugs.    Well,  the  same  thing  is  going  on  now.  Marijuana  was  not  made  illegal  until  1937.  Before  then  the  plant  was  taxed.  It  employed  people.  Now  it  is  not  taxed,  and  those  who  sell  it  are  usually  criminals  of  some  sort  (though  many  are  harmless)    Still,  the  amount  of  marijuana  consumed  has  not  diminished  one  bit.    Cannabis  has  been  used  all  through  recorded  history.      link        What  makes  us  think  that  now,  in  the  last  72  years  something  about  the  plant  has  changed.    Marijuana's  illegal  status  is  a  historical  farce.  It's  laughable,  pointless,  and  counter  productive.    1.  Marijuana  is  a  better  pain  killer,  with  less  harmful  side  effects  than  any  perscription  drug.  It  costs  less  (0  if  you  have  dirt  and  water  already)  and  it's  less  addictive.    Are  there  harmful  side  effects  of  marijuana?  Yes,  but  no  more  so  than  any  other  drug  including  alcohol,  tobacco,  or  caffiene.      2.  Taxes  collected  from  the  sale  of  marijuana  would  be  in  the  hundreds  of  millions,  it  would  give  our  economy  an  enourmous  boost  and  employ  potentially  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people.    3.  It  would  take  the  money  from  illegal  drugs    out  of    the  hands  of  criminals.    4.  It  would  be  a  huge  relief  on  our  overcrowded  prisons,  saving  States  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  a  year,  even  millions  in  States  with  large  prison  populations  like  CA.  Also,  it  would  save  the  18  year  old  A  student  and  college  hopeful  from  losing  all  his  scholarships  and  having  to  check    YES    on  every  application  that  asks  if  they've  ever  been  arrested,  for  the  rest  of  his  or  her  life,  just  because  they  had  a  tiny  amount  of  a  plant  that  is  far  safer  than  alcohol.    and  by  all  means,  come  visit  my  blog  sometime,  www.crazydrugnews.blogspot.com.	0

Those  who  appreciate  their  own  free  choice  of  personal  path  in  life  should  not  deny  self-exploration  to  seekers.  The  right  to  the  pursuit  of  happiness  is  supposed  to  be  inalienable  by  government.    Simple  majorities  in  each  house  could  put  repeal  of  the  CSA  on  the  president’s  desk.  The  books  have  ample  law  on  them  without  the  CSA.  Americans  are  already  liable  for  damages  when  they  screw-up.  The  usual  caveats  remain  in  effect.  Strong  medicine  requires  prescription.  Employees  can  be  fired  for  poor  job  performance.  No  harm,  no  foul;  and  no  excuse,  either.

The  right  to  the  pursuit  of  happiness  is  supposed  to  be  inalienable  by  government.    Simple  majorities  in  each  house  could  put  repeal  of  the  CSA  on  the  president’s  desk.  The  books  have  ample  law  on  them  without  the  CSA.  Americans  are  already  liable  for  damages  when  they  screw-up.  The  usual  caveats  remain  in  effect.  Strong  medicine  requires  prescription.  Employees  can  be  fired  for  poor  job  performance.  No  harm,  no  foul;  and  no  excuse,  either.  Replace  the  war  on  drugs  with  a  frugal,  constitutional,  science-based  drugs  policy.[SEP]Yeah,  I  think  the  reason  it's  gone  on  so  long  is  dealers  and  laundering  banks  make  their  money  under  the  black  market  system.  But  it  could  change  again.  Look  at  prohibition.    The  biggest  effect  would  be  an  end  to  brutal  mandatory  sentencing  of  long  jail  times  that  has  ruined  so  many  young  peoples  lives.	0
We  should  stop  trying  to  stop  the  pot  heads.    I  hate  drugs  too  because  they  are  unhealthy  &  deadly  but  I  don't  think  the  government  should  be  arresting  people  for  doing  them.    I  think  drugs  including  tobacco  &  alcohol  should  be  banned  from  public  stores.    It  shouldn't  be  illegal.  If  it  is  illegal  where  you  arrest  anybody  who  does  pot  then  that  just  causes  more  problems.    So  here  is  the  answer:  legalize  pot  &  other  illegal  drugs  but  ban  them,  tobacco  &  alcohol  from  public  stores.	0

People  will  be  harming  themselves  with  dirty  alcohol,  tobacco,  and  other  drugs  because  of  lack  of  regulation  on  these  substances.  It's  currently  a  problem  with  cannabis  because  it's  illegal.    You  are  on  the  right  track  though,  making  them  illegal  is  definately  the  wrong  way  to  go  about  it.	0
Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.    I  think  we  could  save  so  much  time  and  money  just  by  treating  Marijuana  like  a  mixture  of  Cigarettes  and  Alcohol.    You  don't  smoke  in  public  places.    You  don't  drive  while  under  the  influence.    And  we  can  tax  it.  I'd  bet  it  would  still  be  cheaper  than  today.  It  wouldn't  be  such  a  risk  to  transport  and  sell,  and  more  people  would  be  doing  it.[SEP]Following  your  arguments:    1.  Don't  people  still  smoke  cigarettes  on  the  street?    2.  Don't  people  still  drive  drunk?    (Just  because  you  set  these  rules  doesn't  mean  people  will  follow  them.)    3.  Marijuana  would  not  be  cheaper  than  it  is  today.  If  the  government  had  control  over  it  they  would  make  the  price  way  higher  than  it  is  at  street  value.  And  this  wouldn't  stop  drug  lords,  do  they  not  have  cigarettes  on  the  black  market  at  dirt  cheap  prices?  Wouldn't  you  buy  from  someone  growing  themselves  at  a  cheaper  price  to  avoid  a  tax?  How  does  that  stimulate  a  business  let  alone  the  whole  economy?    4.  The  last  thing  we  need  is  more  people  doing  it.  More  people  making  it  a  problem  for  themselves,  more  people  ending  up  in  rehab  at  the  governments  expense.  In  fact  I  hate  being  around  people  doing  it.  They're  so  slow  and  stupid  with  their  dumb  eyes  all  squinted.  I  want  to  slap  them  and  give  them  a  good  shake  to  snap  out  of  it.    Your  points  have  got  to  be  the  typical  pothead's  standpoint  on  this  issue  and  it's  not  good  enough,  sorry.    Legalizing  is  not  the  solution.[SEP]Well,  yes,  people  still  do  those  things.  Don't  people  still  murder  other  people?  Don't  people  still  embezzle  money?  All  this  still  happens,  but  because  it  is  illegal,  it  takes  place  less  often.  Don't  people  still  sell  marijuana  and  don't  people  still  smoke  it?  Yes,  they  do.  It's  just  much  more  dangerous  and  expensive  to  do  so  because  it's  illegal.    I  believe  the  core  of  our  disagreement  here  seems  to  be  that  we  have  opposing  viewpoints  on  marijuana  alone,  whereas  you  seem  to  think  of  it  as  something  bad;  some  kind  of  scourge  of  society.  I  don't  see  it  that  way.  There  has  been  endless  debate  over  whether  or  not  marijuana  is  harmful,  and  I  choose  to  believe  it's  really  not  that  bad.  Either  way,  it  should  be  a  level-minded  individual's  choice  to  smoke  marijuana,  just  like  it's  their  choice  if  they  wish  to  smoke  cigarettes  or  drink  alcohol,  both  very  destructive  substances,  yet  still  legal.  My  core  belief  is  that  it  should  be  the  individual's  choice  whether  to  do  something  or  not.    Although  there  is  some  small  chance  that  you  are    not    calling  me  a  pothead,  let's  get  something  straight;  I've  never  smoked  marijuana,  I've  never  done  any  other  drug,  I  don't  drink  alcohol,  I  don't  smoke  cigarettes,  and  to  be  honest,  I  really  don't  plan  on  doing  any  of  the  above.  I've  made  it  thus  far  without  them,  and  I  don't  have  any  real  reason  to  start  now.  So,  because  of  this,  I  can  say  that  I  have  reasoning  beyond  what  is  simply  personally  more  convenient.      The  war  on  marijuana,  not  all  drugs,  but  marijuana,  sucks  up    so  much    federal,  state,  and  local  money.  Couldn't  this  money  be  better  spent  enforcing  the  other  laws,  say,  the  ones  that  keep  people  under  the  influence  off  the  roads?  Or  maybe  we  could  put  this  money  towards  something  we  can  all  enjoy,  like  lowering  taxes.  There  are  just  better  ways  to  spend  our  money.    You  make  good  points,  and  I  understand  what  you  are  getting  at,  I  just  wholeheartedly  disagree.[SEP]Ok  that  is  fine,  good  explanations.  But  if  they  legalize  weed  and  see  how  much  of  a  problem  it  becomes  then  make  it  illegal  again,  it  will  only  make  things  worse.  Remember  prohibition?  I've  never  done  any  drugs  myself,  sure  I've  drank  my  share  of  alcohol  and  I'm  not  even  of  age  to  do  so,  but  I'm  not  a  drunk.  And  I  wasn't  calling  you  a  pothead,  I  was  saying  it  in  general.  I  just  feel  it'll  cause  more  problems  in  the  long  run  with  people  becoming  "addicted"  to  it  and  needing  help  to  get  off  of  it.  And  as  far  as  it  goes  for  medicinal  purposes,  marijuana  does  not  cure  anything  in  which  many  people  try  and  use  that  excuse  because  they  think  it  does.  It  is  for  the  sole  purpose  of  numbing  the  pain  in  cancer  patients  in  which  they  can  switch  to  other  alternatives  and  also  making  patients  hungry  so  they  eat  more  and  gain  weight  on  their  sick  bodies.[SEP]How  do  you  know  if  Marijuana  helps  or  doesn't  help  people  in  need?  That's  a  pretty  bold  statement  to  make  for  everyone  that's  had  any  ailment  (which  there  are  many:  migraines,  insomnia,  post  traumatic  stress  disorder,  PMS,  etc.)  that  pot  could  help,  don't  you  think?  Where's  the  evidence  to  back  this  up?    Pot  is  not  physically  addicting.  However,  caffeine,  is  addictive.  Whether  or  not  something  is  or  isn't  addictive  shouldn't  be  the  only  criteria  for  determining  it's  safety  within  society.  If  it  were,  then  all  pain  killers  would  be  illegal  in  addition  to  coffee  and  tea  and  probably  television.	0

But  I  don't  think  there  is  a  big  black  market  in  alcohol,  so  I  would  not  be  too  fussy  over  how  it  was  legalized  exactly.  But  it  would  be  better  to  have  less  hassles  over  it.    But  the  main  benefit  would  be  ending  mandatory  sentencing,  which  has  ruined  so  many  young  peoples  lives.	0

I  can  understand  why  you  would  want  to  have  some  control  over  distribution,  keep  it  away  from  kids.  But  i  don't  know  what  a  public  store  is.  Where  would  you  buy  it  then,  a  private  store?  I  don't  know  what  that  means.    But  anyway,  the  greatest  benefit  would  be  an  end  to  mandatory  sentencing  that  has  destroyed  so  many  young  peoples  lives.	0
war  is  stupid  your  never  going  to  win  just  give  up  and  give  the  kids  what  they  want  because  your  wasting  your  time	0
okay.  so  the  only  reason  weed  is  illegal  is  because  the  freaking  usa  cant  put  a  tax  on  it,  it  being  to  easy  to  grow.  well  tell  me  how  that  makes  any  since..  many  people  have  vegetable  gardens...  yet  vegies  arent  illegal  and  there  easy  grown  as  well.  so  that  makes  no  since  not  to  be  able  to  tax  weed.  its  a  plant  for  crying  out  loud!!.  it  was  out  on  earth  for  a  reason  to  keep  peace!.  so  smoke  it  up  and  spread  the  peace!.  obama  should  legalize  it!  for  one..  they  need  more  money  in  the  economy..  they  would  make  a  shit  load  if  stores  started  selling  weed  and  we  would  be  out  of  recession,  only  everyone  would  be  a  pot  head.  so  what  if  everyone  was  it  would  be  normal  right?.	0
yes  do  it  cuz  many  people  do  it  and  the  law  dosnt  stop  it  from  happining  so  they  brake  the  law  so  we  might  as  well  just  legilize  it.	0
ALL  DRUGS  should  be  controlled  and  legalized.  From  Cocaine  to  Marijuana.    Primarily  for  safety  &  health  reasons,  but  mainly  to  eliminate  the  cash  flows  going  to  dangerous  groups  and  factions.      Legalizing  ALL  DRUGS  would  be  the  best  solution  for  homeland  security  debilitating  international  drug  lords  ability  to  finance  terrorism  while  giving  the  government  more  financial  maneuverability  to  adequately  finance  education,  health  care,  and  effective  crime  prevention.	0
Dude,  just  like,  legalize  it  and  stuff.    My  heart  just  gushes  over  kush.    I'm  keen  for  green.    I  bleed  for  weed.    hehehehe,  rhymes.    But  honestly,  it  should  be  legalized.	0
There  is  absolutly  nothing  wrong  with  smoking  marijuana!  in  fact  there  are  many  more  fatality  or  deaths  using  alchool  every  year.  Make  pot  legal,  tax  it,  and  put  rules  and  regulations  along  with  it  just  as  they  did  with  alchool!  Years  ago  alchool  was  illegal  and  bootleggers  were  dealing  all  over  the  world  and  if  caught  you  would  spend  time  in  jail!  Nowdays  this  is  true  with  pot  and  we  are  filiing  up  the  jails  with  drugdealers  petty  pot  charges  and  theres  no  room  for  the  real  criminals  such  as  the  rappist  and  murderers!	0
I  think  so  on  POT  ,  I  dont  have  a  need  for  it  ,  i  dont  drink  ..  but  the  Government  allows  the  sale  of  many  items  that  can  kill  us  ,  Legalize  it  and  tax,  like  they  do  everything  else..  it  ..	0
I  doubt  the  war  on  drugs  will  end,  but  I  believe  a  person  should  be  able  to  put  into  their  body  what  they  want.	0

yeah,  so  all  the  stupid  people  can  be  stoned  in  their  house  instead  of  out  on  the  streets  with  a  picket  sign.[SEP]I    reeeeeallly    hate  when  you  put  words  in  my  mouth.  I  didn't  say  a  single  thing  you  attributed  to  me  in  this  rebuttal.      I  hope  this  is  the  product  of  tangential  thought,  and  not  a  conscious  effort  to  shift  the  discussion  away  from  what  you  can  no  longer  defend.    In  response:  When  you're  making  assertions  about  their  effects  on  musicians,  firsthand  experience  goes  a  long  way.  Especially  in  discussions  of  (as  yet)  qualitative  distinctions  between  two  modes  of  creative  catalysis.      I'm  not  saying  musicians  who  don't  do  drugs  are  better.  I  do  know  that  the  greatest  innovators  have  almost  all  been  drug  users.      I  couldn't  tell  you  whether  abstainers  are  holding  themselves  back,  I'm  not  fucking  psychic.  Drugs  have  different  effects  on  everyone.  If  I  had  to  guess,  I  would  say  yes,  they  probably  would  be  a  tiny  bit  more  creative  if  they  tried  certain  drugs.  Note  that  this  belief  is    not  mutually  exclusive    with  the  idea  that  drugs  aren't  needed  to  be  creative.    You  know,  if  it  sounds  too  stupid  for  someone  to  have  argued  it,  why  don't  you  read  back  over  it  and  see  if  they  really  did?  I'm  still  in  utter  disbelief  that  you  think  I  said    all  of  that  BS  .[SEP]I  disagree  with  your  assertion  that  only  stupid  people  do  weed.  A  large  portion  of  modern  music  an  art  has  been  inspired  by  marijuana.  These  people  were  intelligent  and  creative  and  marijuana  allowed  helped  them  reach  there  potential  as  artists.  I  also  know  plenty  of  very  intelligent  people  who  currently  use  or  have  used  the  drug.[SEP]i  guess  joke  isn't  in  your  vocabulary,  but  since  you  decided  to  go  about  it...  lets  refute  some  of  this.    most  of  the  artists  did  waaaaay  more  than  weed.  weed  is  not  the  most  inspirational  type  of  drug,  all  it  does  is  relax  your  brain  so  you  stop  thinking  at  all.  LSD,  on  the  other  hand,  has  actually  been  apart  of  the  music  industry  waaaay  more  than  weed.  and  still,  i  wouldn't  call  most  artists  intelligent  at  all.  creative,  sure,  but  intelligent???      i  never  said  that  ONLY  stupid  people  do  weed,  but  at  least  all  the  stupid  people  who  do  (cause  i  know  way  more  stupid  people  who  do  than  smart  people)  will  just  be  at  home  instead  of  wasting  my  time  with  their  protests.[SEP]"weed  is  not  the  most  inspirational  type  of  drug,  all  it  does  is  relax  your  brain  so  you  stop  thinking  at  all"      Have  you  ever  smoked  weed?  A  lot  of  the  arguments  I'm  seeing  on  here  tend  to  revolve  around  the  equation  weed  =  crack.  Weed  does  not  equal  crack,  no  matter  how  much  the  bullshit  anti-weed  propagandists  wish  it  were  so.  I've  smoked  a  ton  of  weed  and  it  blows  me  away  every  time.  I  get  amazing  ideas,  have  awesome  realizations  about  myself  and  people  around  me,  and  they  still  seem  awesome  later  on..even  when  I'm  not  high.    "....(cause  i  know  way  more  stupid  people  who  do  than  smart  people)"      Maybe  that's  because  you  just  know  mostly  stupid  people  in  general.  Could  be  a  biased  sample.    Bill  Maher,  Mayor  Bloomberg,  Richard  Feynman  (Nobel  Prize  winning  physicist),  Carl  Sagan  (Cosmos),  Friedrich  Nietzsche,  guess  what?  All  potheads.[SEP]not  saying  a  smart  person  becomes  dumb  when  smoking  weed.  but  chemically  it  can't  make  you  smarter  or  "more  inspirational".  the  problem  is  that  many  people  might  be  too  stressed  to  come  up  with  good  ideas,  and  weed  makes  you  fucked  up  enough  to  not  care.  Even  potheads  will  vouche  for  that.    and  like  i  said,  i  want  it  to  be  legal,  so  that  dumb  people  will  be  less  motivated  to  mess  with  me.[SEP]so  you're  saying  that  if  the  jazz  musicians  didn't  use  it...  they  wouldn't  make  as  good  music?    especially  since  weed  isn't  a  hallucinogenic  drug  or  any  of  that,  it's  hard  to  believe  that  it  can  actually  create  good  ideas.  what  it  does  is  reduce  stress  levels  at  a  max.  those  who  are  less  stress  MIGHT  be  able  to  think  better.    it  mainly  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  many  musicians  just  like  to  do  weed  and  other  drugs.  look  at  Ray  Charles.  do  you  think  heroin  actually  helped  him  make  his  music?  he  did  a  shit  load  of  it.[SEP]First,  have  you  smoked  weed?  Have  you  done  acid?  Do  you  play  an  instrument?  Scholarly  resources  can  only  tell  you  so  much  about  the  drugs  and  how  they  affect  people.      I'm  saying  that  during  jazz's  first  creative  explosion,  weed  was  a  major  factor  in  the  community.  And  yes,  lowered  stress  is  an  excellent  way  to  make  better  music.  I'm  assuming  you  haven't  smoked  weed  before;  it  becomes  pretty  easy  to  imagine  complete  composition  of  a  song  in  your  head,  compared  to  sobriety.  While  the  effect  of  acid  is  more  extreme  in  its  increase  of  creativity,  it's  effect  was  narrow  and  short-lived  on  the  music  industry  as  a  whole.  Weed  is  the  only  drug  done  by  every  single  segment  of  society.    Heroin  is  heroin.  If  anything,  it  held  him  back.  I  wasn't  arguing  for  Ray  Charles.[SEP]so,  basically,  i  HAVE  to  do  drugs  in  order  to  know  how  great  they  are...    i  do  play  instruments,  and  i  do  just  find  without  drugs.    so  i  guess  straight  edge  bands  would  be  better  if  they  weren't  straight  edge...  they're  actually  limiting  themselves  by  staying  clean.  you  seem  to  act  as  if  weed  is  smoked  by  EVERY  musician.  maybe  weed  is  just  a  fun,  harmless  drug  and  that's  why  so  many  musicians  do  it  compared  to  hard  drugs.  but  what  about  the  creative  geniuses  who  don't  do  them?  are  they  just  holding  themselves  back?      or  are  you  willing  to  say  that  they're  strong  enough  to  not  need  drugs  in  order  to  further  their  creative  process.	1
yeah,  so  all  the  stupid  people  can  be  stoned  in  their  house  instead  of  out  on  the  streets  with  a  picket  sign.[SEP]so  you  do  agree  with  the  fact  that  drug  use  doesn't  make  a  better  musician...  or  do  you?    you  seem  to  switching  back  and  fourth.    the  argument  really  started  with  that.  I  said  weed  doesn't  make  a  better  musician.[SEP]I  disagree  with  your  assertion  that  only  stupid  people  do  weed.

All  potheads.[SEP]not  saying  a  smart  person  becomes  dumb  when  smoking  weed.  but  chemically  it  can't  make  you  smarter  or  "more  inspirational".  the  problem  is  that  many  people  might  be  too  stressed  to  come  up  with  good  ideas,  and  weed  makes  you  fucked  up  enough  to  not  care.  Even  potheads  will  vouche  for  that.    and  like  i  said,  i  want  it  to  be  legal,  so  that  dumb  people  will  be  less  motivated  to  mess  with  me.[SEP]so  you're  saying  that  if  the  jazz  musicians  didn't  use  it...  they  wouldn't  make  as  good  music?    especially  since  weed  isn't  a  hallucinogenic  drug  or  any  of  that,  it's  hard  to  believe  that  it  can  actually  create  good  ideas.  what  it  does  is  reduce  stress  levels  at  a  max.  those  who  are  less  stress  MIGHT  be  able  to  think  better.    it  mainly  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  many  musicians  just  like  to  do  weed  and  other  drugs.  look  at  Ray  Charles.  do  you  think  heroin  actually  helped  him  make  his  music?  he  did  a  shit  load  of  it.[SEP]First,  have  you  smoked  weed?  Have  you  done  acid?  Do  you  play  an  instrument?  Scholarly  resources  can  only  tell  you  so  much  about  the  drugs  and  how  they  affect  people.      I'm  saying  that  during  jazz's  first  creative  explosion,  weed  was  a  major  factor  in  the  community.  And  yes,  lowered  stress  is  an  excellent  way  to  make  better  music.  I'm  assuming  you  haven't  smoked  weed  before;  it  becomes  pretty  easy  to  imagine  complete  composition  of  a  song  in  your  head,  compared  to  sobriety.  While  the  effect  of  acid  is  more  extreme  in  its  increase  of  creativity,  it's  effect  was  narrow  and  short-lived  on  the  music  industry  as  a  whole.  Weed  is  the  only  drug  done  by  every  single  segment  of  society.    Heroin  is  heroin.  If  anything,  it  held  him  back.  I  wasn't  arguing  for  Ray  Charles.[SEP]so,  basically,  i  HAVE  to  do  drugs  in  order  to  know  how  great  they  are...    i  do  play  instruments,  and  i  do  just  find  without  drugs.    so  i  guess  straight  edge  bands  would  be  better  if  they  weren't  straight  edge...  they're  actually  limiting  themselves  by  staying  clean.  you  seem  to  act  as  if  weed  is  smoked  by  EVERY  musician.  maybe  weed  is  just  a  fun,  harmless  drug  and  that's  why  so  many  musicians  do  it  compared  to  hard  drugs.  but  what  about  the  creative  geniuses  who  don't  do  them?  are  they  just  holding  themselves  back?      or  are  you  willing  to  say  that  they're  strong  enough  to  not  need  drugs  in  order  to  further  their  creative  process.	0
yeah,  so  all  the  stupid  people  can  be  stoned  in  their  house  instead  of  out  on  the  streets  with  a  picket  sign.[SEP]I  was  aware  that  you  were  for  the  most  part  joking,  I  just  get  a  little  annoyed  when  people  say  that  people  who  do  weed  are  stupid  (not  that  this  is  what  you  said).    As  for  music,  I  can  give  you  a  whole  list  of  artists  and  songs  that  were  influenced  by  marijuana.  My  favorite  example  would  be  Bob  Marley  but  there  are  many  others.      I  would  say  that  the  reason  you  know  more  stupid  people  than  smart  people  that  do  weed  is  probably  because  there  are  more  stupid  people  in  in  the  world  than  smart  people,  but  then  again  I  don't  know  who  you  hang  out  with  so  I  can't  make  a  judgment.      If  you  look  at  most  collages,  especially  liberal  ones,  you  will  find  a  significant  portion  of  the  student  body  either  has  tried  or  regularly  uses  marijuana.  What  this  says  to  me  is  that  there  are  a  significant  amount  of  intelligent  people  who  do  use  the  drug.[SEP]I  disagree  with  your  assertion  that  only  stupid  people  do  weed.  A  large  portion  of  modern  music  an  art  has  been  inspired  by  marijuana.  These  people  were  intelligent  and  creative  and  marijuana  allowed  helped  them  reach  there  potential  as  artists.  I  also  know  plenty  of  very  intelligent  people  who  currently  use  or  have  used  the  drug.[SEP]i  guess  joke  isn't  in  your  vocabulary,  but  since  you  decided  to  go  about  it...  lets  refute  some  of  this.    most  of  the  artists  did  waaaaay  more  than  weed.  weed  is  not  the  most  inspirational  type  of  drug,  all  it  does  is  relax  your  brain  so  you  stop  thinking  at  all.  LSD,  on  the  other  hand,  has  actually  been  apart  of  the  music  industry  waaaay  more  than  weed.  and  still,  i  wouldn't  call  most  artists  intelligent  at  all.  creative,  sure,  but  intelligent???      i  never  said  that  ONLY  stupid  people  do  weed,  but  at  least  all  the  stupid  people  who  do  (cause  i  know  way  more  stupid  people  who  do  than  smart  people)  will  just  be  at  home  instead  of  wasting  my  time  with  their  protests.	0
I  have  always  felt  that  it  should  be  DECRIMINALIZED.  Some  states  (like  Texas)  treat  it  as  bad  as  homicide.  At  worst,  it  should  be  a  fine  for  quantities  over  a  few  ounces.      I  know  better  than  to  presume  it  would  ever  be  "legal"  but  certainly  we  waste  boatloads  of  tax  dollars  worrying  about  this  silly  drug  when  we  should  be  concerned  about  rapists,  crack  dealers,  and  corrupt  politicians.	0
I  support  legalizing  marijuana,  because  those  countries  that  have  marijuana  legal  have  less  problems  with  schedule  1  drugs.  What  happens  in  the  US  is  that  those  who  do  smoke  marijuana  get  caught  with  it  and  get  put  on  probation.  While  they  are  on  probation  that  start  using  Schedule  1  drugs  like  Cocaine,  which  exits  your  system  in  no  more  than  72hrs.  This  is  why  marijuana  is  a  gateway  drug.  For  those  who  do  not  smoke  marijuana,  I  don't  think  that  making  it  legal  would  make  much  of  a  difference.  Marijuana  is  like  cigarettes  being  so  easy  to  come  by  that  if  you  wanted  to  smoke  it  you  would  go  get  you  some.  By  legalizing  marijuana  maybe  some  of  our  tax  money  used  to  keep  those  in  prison  for  having  marijuana  could  go  towards  something  better,  like  education.	0
1.  Weed  is  not  physiologically  addictive,  as  opposed  to  say..tobacco    2.  You  can't  OD  on  weed  like  you  can  with  alcohol  -  you  have  to  eat  like  four  pounds  of  it  or  something.    3.  It  has  little  to  no  long  term  negative  effects  (decreases  in  short  term  memory  +  attention  span  for  people  smoking  once  a  day  for  like  30  years)    4.  Although  Obama  recently  dismissed  the  idea,  weed  would  be  good  for  the  economy  -  You  tax  it,  people  buy  it,  the  government  makes  bank.      5.  Weed  helps  you  think  in  new  ways.  What's  wrong  with  that?    6.  Mexico  is  imploding  right  now  because  of  drug  cartels  whose  main  cash  crop  is  weed.    One  of  the  best  arguments  I've  heard  made  is  that  weed  is  no  worse  than  alcohol  or  tobacco.  No  matter  what  else,  if  that's  true,  then  there  is  no  reason  for  weed  not  to  also  be  legal.      Sure  people  can  become  psychologically  addicted  to  weed,  but  they  can  get  addicted  to  alcohol,  cigarettes,  gambling  just  as  easily.  All  of  which  are  already  legal.	0

Lung  cells  have  a  part  of  their  DNA  that  serves  as  a  self-destruct  mechanism,  so  new  ones  can  grow  in.  Tobacco  destroys  this  sequence,  so  cells  will  keep  replicating  without  self-destructing.  Marijuana  just  kills  the  cell  outright  instead  of  messing  up  its  DNA,  so  it's  not  only  less  harmful,  it  can  prevent  a  bit  of  the  damage  tobacco  does.  Cuts  tumor  growth  by  half  in  mice.	0
My  Spring  semester  of  my  freshman  year  in  college  was  when  I  discovered  weed.  This  semester  I  pulled  3  A's  and  a  B,  successfully  worked  out  five  days  a  week  despite  "the  munchies"  and  held  a  steady  job.  I  was  not  late  for  class  or  the  job,  and  thus  disproved  that  pot  smokers  are  unproductive  members  of  society.  At  my  peak  I  was  smoking  once  every  day.  Statistics  also  show  that  no  one  has  died  as  a  result  of  weed,  nor  gotten  addicted,  nor  gotten  a  "hangover"  the  morning  after,  and  alcohol  has  led  me  to  do  more  things  I  regretted,  disproving  that  weed  is  the  true  "gateway"  drug.  Weed  has  also  been  scientifically  proven  to  NOT  directly  cause  lung  cancer  as  cigarettes  do,  and  if  legalized,  the  revenue  will  soar  sky  high.  Legalize  it!	0
because  it  expands  the  horizons  and  if  you  get  high  you  feel  good  but  dont  have  too  much  coz  thats  just  stupid	0

First  off  weed  is  a  great  source  for  clothing,  rope,  fuel,  and  medician.[SEP]Isn't  that  funny...I  don't  think  your  question  had  anything  to  do  with  HEMP  being  useful.  I  used  to  be  a  weed  smoker  in  the  60's,  70's  and  80's  along  with  other  things  offered  along  the  way.  I  never  really  drank  so  pot  was  a  miracle  to  me.  I've  thought  about  it  for  many  years  and  today  we  know  a  great  deal  about  what  we  inhale  or  ingest  than  we  did  back  then.    After  all  that  wonderful  thinking  I  came  to  the  conclusion  that  weed  should  not  be  legalized  because  of  the  abuse  factor  and  not  for  any  other  reason.  If  I  was  still  out  there  partying  like  I  did  years  ago,  I'd  probably  enjoy  a  few  tokes  for  a  nice  buzz  and  although  marijuana  itself  does  NOT  lead  to  other  drugs,  in  the  wrong  hands  a  person  with  an  addictive  mindset/personality  WILL  go  past  the  joint  or  two  over  the  week-end.  Pot  laced  with  what  have  you  will  send  you  reeling  and  there  is  plenty  of  stuff  out  there  to  lace  it  with.  For  the  safety  of  all,  I  would  say  no,  don't  legalize  it  with  the  exception  of  those  who  are  terminally  ill  and  have  been  prescribed  it  to  calm  them  and  take  away  some  of  the  pain.	1

Indecisive?  Not  I..lol!      You're  right  that  not  many  people  ask  where  their  stuff  is  from  but  even  the  dealer  has  a  duty  to  the  buyer  to  expose  a  heavy  additive.  There  is  such  a  thing  as  honor  among  thieves  you  know!!!  In  my  time  if  we  found  weed  laced  with  angel  dust  or  whatever  the  buyer  would  go  back  and  beat  that  dealer  to  a  pulp.  A  bad  dealer  gets  no  customers  and  word  goes  around  like  wildfire.  If  you  found  a  good  one  you'd  usually  stay  with  him  depending  on  seed  and  unsmokable  content.  If  MJ  were  sold  legally  and  those  who  bought  it  wanted  it  laced,  they'd  do  it  themselves.  I  don't  know  if  people  would  use  it  as  a  substitute  for  tobacco  or  alcohol  though.  It's  an  entirely  different  feeling  and  effect.  You're  absolutely  on  target  with  the  medical  aspects  though.    I  agree  also  with  the  taboo/illegal  factor.  The  mental  aspect  is  there  and  always  has  been.  It's  not  unlike  anything  else  that  has  not  be  legalized.  I'm  not  sure  I  believe  the  statistics  here  or  abroad.  I'd  have  to  see  how,  what,  and  whom  they  asked.  I'd  like  to  think  they  would  give  a  great  deal  of  weight  to  a  certain  age  group.	1

I  spent  all  weekend  pulling  weeds  and  spraying  Round-Up  and  laying  plastic  down  to  keep  the  weeds  from  coming  up  again,  etc.  If  I  had  my  druthers  I  would  ban  weeds  so  fast  it  would  make  your  head  spin  and  further  more  I  would.....  wait.....  we're  not  talking  the  same  thing,  are  we?	1
It  is  proven  that  pots  and  other  related  substances  can  do  harm  not  for  just  one  self  but  for  the  society  as  a  whole.  And  if  we  want  this  to  be  legalize,  then  we  will  try  to  legalize  too  some  harmful  substances  again  soon  after.  This  is  not  the  solution  to  the  problem.  And  the  Bureau  of  Food  and  Drugs  wouldn't  set  it  illegal  for  nothing.	1
Weed  is  already  legal  in  other  countries.  If  you  don't  agree  with  this  policy  of  American  law,  then  GTFO  and  go  somewhere  that  suits  your  needs  better.

If  we  legalize  something  that  makes  people  stop  caring  about  their  lives  and  only  want  to  get  "high"  then  we  are  pretty  much  setting  a  course  for  our  downfall  as  a  civilization.[SEP]Altarion  I  have  never  and  plan  never  to  smoke  pot,  but  I  know  plenty  of  people  that  do  smoke  pot.    Weed  is  not  physically  addictive  like  cigarettes  are,  pot  does  not  make  people  stop  caring  about  their  lives  at  all.  Drugs  like  meth  can  do  things  like  that  as  well  as  heroine  or  cocaine  but  not  marijuana.  Jane  can  be  considered  a  gateway  drug  and  in  a  lot  of  cases  jane  is  a  lot  less  harmful  that  alcohol  is  to  our  bodies.  Pot  does  not  do  anywhere  near  as  much  damage  to  those  around  us  than  what  alcohol  does,  getting  high  is  just  like  a  boost  for  the  day.  I  know  students  that  are  in  the  top  of  my  sophomore  class  that  smoke  pot  regularly  and  are  within  top  20  out  of  a  600  student  class.    The  only  thing  I  see  that  could  come  out  of  legalizing  weed  would  be  that  since  Americans  already  spend  their  money  on  weed  now  why  not  tax  the  shit  and  bring  the  US  gov  some  extra  pocket  change?	0
Weed  is  already  legal  in  other  countries.  If  you  don't  agree  with  this  policy  of  American  law,  then  GTFO  and  go  somewhere  that  suits  your  needs  better.  The  reason  most  people  want  to  live  in  America  is  because  we  have  amazing  policies  and  laws  that  not  many  other  countries  have.  So  if  you  are  going  to  make  a  fuss  over  a  stupid  thing  like  this,  then  just  GTFO  of  America  and  move  to  somewhere  in  Europe,  South  America,  or  Mexico.[SEP]Um.  Ever  heard  of  prohibition?    Ever  read  about  how  it  got  overturned  because  of  american  citizens  revolting  against  it?    The  fact  that  people  can  come  together  to  change  laws  is  part  of  what  makes  this  country  great.[SEP]Revolutions  have  happened  and  have  been  successful  in  the  past,  but  honestly,  who  is  going  to  support  a  revolution  to  legalize  a  drug  like  Pot  to  be  used  when  it  was  banned  for  our  protection?  And  don't  even  say  "We  revolted  against  the  ban  of  alcohol."  because  it  is  quite  obvious  that  Pot  does  far  more  damage  to  yourself  and  those  around  you  than  alcohol  does.  The  fact  that  we  can  revolt  against  something  doesn't  mean  we  should.  If  we  legalize  something  that  makes  people  stop  caring  about  their  lives  and  only  want  to  get  "high"  then  we  are  pretty  much  setting  a  course  for  our  downfall  as  a  civilization.[SEP]I'd  love  to  see  where  your  facts  come  from,  because  every  medical  journal  i've  ever  read  (including  the  British  government)  have  said  that  pot  is  LESS  HARMFUL  than  alcohol.    Just  do  a  google  search  and  you'll  find  plenty  of  proof  to  show  that.    It's  also  obvious  you've  never  smoked  pot.  I  know  plenty  of  potheads,  and  none  of  them  "stopped  caring  about  their  lives  and  only  wanted  to  get  high".    You  are  obviously  confusing  pot  or  crack  or  heroin.	0

A  large  portion  of  modern  music  an  art  has  been  inspired  by  marijuana.  These  people  were  intelligent  and  creative  and  marijuana  allowed  helped  them  reach  there  potential  as  artists.  I  also  know  plenty  of  very  intelligent  people  who  currently  use  or  have  used  the  drug.[SEP]i  guess  joke  isn't  in  your  vocabulary,  but  since  you  decided  to  go  about  it...  lets  refute  some  of  this.    most  of  the  artists  did  waaaaay  more  than  weed.  weed  is  not  the  most  inspirational  type  of  drug,  all  it  does  is  relax  your  brain  so  you  stop  thinking  at  all.  LSD,  on  the  other  hand,  has  actually  been  apart  of  the  music  industry  waaaay  more  than  weed.  and  still,  i  wouldn't  call  most  artists  intelligent  at  all.  creative,  sure,  but  intelligent???      i  never  said  that  ONLY  stupid  people  do  weed,  but  at  least  all  the  stupid  people  who  do  (cause  i  know  way  more  stupid  people  who  do  than  smart  people)  will  just  be  at  home  instead  of  wasting  my  time  with  their  protests.[SEP]"weed  is  not  the  most  inspirational  type  of  drug,  all  it  does  is  relax  your  brain  so  you  stop  thinking  at  all"      Have  you  ever  smoked  weed?  A  lot  of  the  arguments  I'm  seeing  on  here  tend  to  revolve  around  the  equation  weed  =  crack.  Weed  does  not  equal  crack,  no  matter  how  much  the  bullshit  anti-weed  propagandists  wish  it  were  so.  I've  smoked  a  ton  of  weed  and  it  blows  me  away  every  time.

I  wasn't  arguing  for  Ray  Charles.[SEP]so,  basically,  i  HAVE  to  do  drugs  in  order  to  know  how  great  they  are...    i  do  play  instruments,  and  i  do  just  find  without  drugs.    so  i  guess  straight  edge  bands  would  be  better  if  they  weren't  straight  edge...  they're  actually  limiting  themselves  by  staying  clean.  you  seem  to  act  as  if  weed  is  smoked  by  EVERY  musician.  maybe  weed  is  just  a  fun,  harmless  drug  and  that's  why  so  many  musicians  do  it  compared  to  hard  drugs.  but  what  about  the  creative  geniuses  who  don't  do  them?  are  they  just  holding  themselves  back?      or  are  you  willing  to  say  that  they're  strong  enough  to  not  need  drugs  in  order  to  further  their  creative  process.	1
Yes.  In  comparison  to  those  substances  which  we  allow  (alcohol  and  tobacco  being  the  two  most  obvious)  it  is  really  no  worse.  It  is  far  less  potentially  addictive  than  the  other  two,  does  not  appear  to  have  nearly  as  many  physical  ailments  associated  with  it  as  tobacco  or  heavy  alcohol  use,  and  is  much  less  likely  to  incite  violence  than  alcohol.  Some  argue  that  this  marijuana  is  a  gateway  drug.  They  forget  that  many  people  who  use  other  drugs  also  began  drinking  first.  The  reason  further  drug  experimentation  is  more  likely  to  occur  with  pot  use  than  with  alcohol  is  not  because  pot  "leads  one  to  search  for  a  better  high"  (otherwise  we  should  expect  similar  results  with  alcohol,  as  it  is  more  "mellow"  than  harder  drugs)  but  is  almost  certainly  because  one  is  legal  and  the  other  is  not.  Legalization  also  increases  the  amount  of  information  health  agencies  can  get  about  its  use  and  make  it  more  likely  for  heavy  users  to  get  treatment.  And  it  is  simply  ludicrous  for  our  already  strained  prison  and  court  systems  to  have  to  process  people  for  possession  and  distribution  of  a  substance  that  is  roughly  equivalent  to  substances  we  accept.  And  arguably  the  best  point:  we  could  stop  using  taxpayer  money  to  crack  down  on  dealers  and  instead  tax  pot  sales  via  liscenced  distributors.  This  is  a  particularly  timely  point  given  our  government's  deficit.	0

Marijuana  has  been  rated  the  least  harmful  drug  in  a  study  made  in  UK,  which  means  that  there  is  no  less  harm  being  done  to  people  using  the  drug.  Also,  marijuana  has  evidence  of  pharmaceutical  uses,  such  as  treatment  of  glaucoma.  Because  marijuana  can  be  addictive,  the  government  could  sell  the  drug  with  a  high  tax,  which  would  shrink  the  number  of  users  of  marijuana,  and  at  the  same  time,  stimulate  the  economy  with  these  high  payments  going  to  the  government.  Overall,  as  long  people  don't  smoke  marijuana  (there  are  more  ways  to  use  marijuana  outside  of  smoking  it),  legalizing  marijuana  would  be  beneficial.	0

The  majority  of  the  few  health  concerns  with  pot  are  eliminated  with  vaporizers.  .Vaporizers  should  receive  some  type  of  stimulus  with  cannabis  legalization  to  encourage  production  of  more  affordable  ones  and  increased  demand  for  them,  this  could  be  payed  back  by  taxation  of  a  larger  market,  with  more  producers,  distributors,  retailers  and  consumers.	0

First  of  all,  legalization  of  marijuana  will  be  beneficial  for  government  in  many  ways.  The  government  spends  a  huge  amount  of  money  to  fight  drugs,  although  these  costs  looks  not  so  effective  with  the  drug  marijuana,  because  it  is  widely  used,  and  in  my  opinion  probably  marijuana  is  no  more  harmful  than  currently  legal  drugs  such  as  tobacco  and  alcohol.  In  a  recent  study  for  the  Fraser  Institute,  Economist  Stephen  T.  Easton,  it  was  calculated  how  much  tax  revenue  the  Canadian  government  could  gain  by  legalizing  marijuana.  So,  the  study  estimates  that  the  average  price  of  0.5  grams  (a  unit)  of  marijuana  sold  for  $8.60  on  the  street,  while  its  cost  of  production  was  only  $1.70.  If  government  legalize  marijuana  the  price  for  it  will  fall  because  it  will  have  become  readily  available  +  the  government  will  get  taxes.	0

According  to  the  scientist  David  Geffen  cigarette  smokers  may  feel  that  their  tobacco  addiction  is  far  less  harmful  than  smoking  an  illegal  drug  such  as  marijuana.  Marijuana  smokers  who  abstain  from  tobacco  sometimes  boast  that  their  drug  of  choice  is  safer  than  cigarettes.  The  truth  is  that  both  tobacco  and  marijuana  have  damaging  effects.  Those  who  smoke  both  cigarettes  and  marijuana  suffer  the  compound  consequences  of  two  different  drugs  destroying  their  health  simultaneously.That's  why  advice  to  all  smokers  don't  smoke  because  you  can  die  early	1

Furthermore,  let's  imagine  ourselves  in  the  place  of  parents,  father  or  mother  whose  child  was  caught  with  marijuana  in  police.  According  to  laws  of  many  countries,  this  is  a  crime  and  it  will  be  appearing  in  the  personal  file  of  person  all  his  life.  Imagine  yourself,  it's  like  a  spot  for  the  whole  lifetime.  Because  of  this,  many  young  people  break  their  lives,  bacause  once  they  took  a  drug  and  the  police  caught  them.  I  think  it's  a  little  bit  cruel  and  unfair.  As  a  rule,  in  future  these  people  will  have  some  problems  with  work,  with  the  opossite  sex  and  so  on,  and  all  because  they  probably  once  in  his  life  took  a  drug.  Therefore,  if  government  legalize  marijuana  it  will  give  a  real  chance  for  a  happy  life  of  many  young  people  all  around  the  world.	0
As  I  recently  found  the  information  that  the  majority  of  American  people  believe  legalizing  marijuana  is  the  right  course  for  the  country.  In  a  new  Gallup  poll,  50%  of  Americans  is  for  legalizing  marijuana,  while  46  came  out  against  it.  Today  as  I  know  government  spend  a  lot  of  money  to  fight  with  marijuana,  but  I  think  it's  all  done  in  vain  and  ineffective,  because  I  recently  read  an  article  where  it  was  written  that  28.5  million  Americans  age  12  and  older  had  abused  marijuana  at  least  once  in  the  year  prior.  By  contrast,  51.9  percent  of  Americans  age  12  and  older  (or  roughly  100  million  people)  had  used  alcohol  at  least  once  in  the  30  days  prior  to  being  surveyed  in  America.  It  seems  to  me  that  it  would  be  much  better  if  government  direct  all  this  money  to  improve  education  and  medicine.  Likewise,  maybe,  the  rate  of  corruption  will  decrese.	0
marijuana  should  be  legalized  in  our  country  and  also  government  must  produce  it  itself.  Kazakhstan  has  a  really  big  resource  of  marijuana  in  the  South,  in  "CHU"  and  that  place  is  really  famous  around  the  world.  So,  I  think  that  my  country  can  earn  really  big  money,  and  it's  better  to  earn  it,  than  to  exhaust  it  from  citizens.	0

In  reality,  Marijuana  is  just  as  bad  as  tobacco  and  alcohol,  however,  Marijuana  is  proven  to  be  a  gateway  drug  into  crack  cocaine,  heroin,  opium,  etc.  It  is  also  proven  that  the  typical  marijuana  user  smokes  until  high,  not  until  relaxed.  When  a  person  is  high,  he  or  she  is  not  fully  functional.  Most  daily  alcohol  drinkers  do  not  drink  to  get  drunk,  they  drink  until  they're  relaxed,  that  is  one  reason  alcohol  is  legal.  Marijuana  is  unfiltered  and  will  cause  lung  damage  as  well  as  tobacco,  however  tobacco  does  not  affect  how  you  function  while  marijuana  does  (as  previously  stated).  Marijuana  also  has  proven  to  take  a  permanent  toll  on  the  adolescent  brain.  It  has  proven  poorer  performance  on  thinking  tasks,  slower  motor  skill  speed,  poor  attention  span,  poor  verbal  memory,  and  planning  ability.  Even  with  3  weeks  of  abstinence  of  Marijuana,  attention  span  is  permanently  affected  but  motor  skills,  planning  ability,  and  thinking  tasks  have  slightly  increased  but  are  still  affected.  With  Marijuana  use,  the  brain  is  working  harder  than  it  should  causing  stress,  shorter  life  span,  and  a  weaker  body  in  the  long  run.  Though  Marijuana  has  proven  to  help  slow  down  medical  issues,  it  still  only  slows  down,  does  not  cure  the  medical  issue.  Same  goes  with  prescription  medicine.  Most  of  them  only  slow  down  your  issue,  not  get  rid  of  it.  The  reason  prescription  medicines  are  legal  is  because  your  doctor  needs  to  allow  you  to  take  it.  I'm  fine  if  you  use  marijuana  because  your  doctor  prescribes  it  to  you,  however  most  of  the  time,  that  is  not  the  case  and  Marijuana  is  abused  by  many  teens  and  young  adults.  There  is  a  reason  the  future  of  America  (and  the  world)  is  going  downhill.  The  increased  Marijuana  use  in  high  school  and  middle  schoolers  is  one  of  the  main  reasons.	1

It  is  also  proven  that  the  typical  marijuana  user  smokes  until  high,  not  until  relaxed.        Depends  on  the  user.  I've  known  people  who  smoked  until  they  greened  out,  but  others  only  take  a  toke  or  two  to  relax.      When  a  person  is  high,  he  or  she  is  not  fully  functional.        This  is  based  purely  on  personal  observation,  but  I'd  say  that  one  is  more  functional  when  high,  but  functional  in  a  different  manner.      Most  daily  alcohol  drinkers  do  not  drink  to  get  drunk,  they  drink  until  they're  relaxed      Yet  it  still  is  more  damaging  to  the  body  than  weed!      Marijuana  is  unfiltered  and  will  cause  lung  damage  as  well  as  tobacco      Depends  on  how  much  you  smoke.  All  day  every  day,  probably;  but  most  people  aren't  like  that.      however  tobacco  does  not  affect  how  you  function  while  marijuana  does      You  hear  about  drunk  driving  all  the  time,  but  I've  never  heard  of  a  case  where  the  only  intoxicant  involved  was  ganja.      Marijuana  also  has  proven  to  take  a  permanent  toll  on  the  adolescent  brain.      Willing  to  provide  evidence  for  this?      Even  with  3  weeks  of  abstinence  of  Marijuana,  attention  span  is  permanently  affected  but  motor  skills,  planning  ability,  and  thinking  tasks  have  slightly  increased  but  are  still  affected.      As  somebody  who  actually  smokes  pot  occasionally,  I  disagree  with  this.      With  Marijuana  use,  the  brain  is  working  harder  than  it  should  causing  stress,  shorter  life  span,  and  a  weaker  body  in  the  long  run.      That  just  sounds  plain  ridiculous!      Though  Marijuana  has  proven  to  help  slow  down  medical  issues      Slow  down?!  Cheeba  saves  lives!      it  still  only  slows  down,  does  not  cure  the  medical  issue.      Depends  on  the  issue,  I  should  imagine.  It  helps  people  going  through  chemo  to  eat,  which  is  pretty  damn  useful  if  you  want  to,  you  know,  LIVE.      Same  goes  with  prescription  medicine.      Compare  the  negative  side  effects  of,  say,  just  about  any  prescription  medicine  with  the  negative  side  effects  of  sensimilla.  I  dare  you.      The  reason  prescription  medicines  are  legal  is  because  your  doctor  needs  to  allow  you  to  take  it.      The  reason  prescription  medicines  are  legal  is  because  politicians,  doctors,  and  those  involved  with  Big  Pharma  make  shitloads  of  money  from  their  legality.      I'm  fine  if  you  use  marijuana  because  your  doctor  prescribes  it  to  you,  however  most  of  the  time,  that  is  not  the  case      Fortunately.  Herb  should  be  used  because  of  its  benefits  to  all,  not  just  the  sick.      Marijuana  is  abused  by  many  teens  and  young  adults.      As  well  as  many  adults.  Most  people,  once  again  in  my  experience,  do  not  abuse  it.  Most  people  use  it  recreationally,  and  it  does  less  harm  than  good.      There  is  a  reason  the  future  of  America  (and  the  world)  is  going  downhill.      Too  many  trillions  wasted  on  finding  and  incarcerating  those  non-violent  users  of  drugs?

In  reality,  Marijuana  is  just  as  bad  as  tobacco  and  alcohol,  however,  Marijuana  is  proven  to  be  a  gateway  drug  into  crack  cocaine,  heroin,  opium,  etc.  It  is  also  proven  that  the  typical  marijuana  user  smokes  until  high,  not  until  relaxed.

I,  however  love  greek  plays  and  even  though  greek  plays  do  upset  some  people,  there  are  much  worse  problems  in  the  world.    For  one,  why  does  the  government  outlaw  a  plant,  but  it  doesn't  outlaw  war?    In  fact,  why  does  the  government  SUPPORT  war?    What  is  war?  Killing.    Perhaps  one  should  questions  your  government's  motives  before  blindly  obeying.	0

Marijuana  seems  to  be  opposed  purely  on  an  indoctrinational  basis.      Because  it  is  relatively  harmless,  because  it  does  not  cause  hysteria  or  murder  or  other  horrible  effects,  the  only  reason  sane  people  would  so  strongly  desire  to  outlaw  a  plant  is  because  they  were  taught  from  an  early  age  that  this  plant  is  horrible  and  illegal.    Nearly  everyone  opposed  to  it  has  never  tried  it  more  than  once.  It  is  well  known  that  not  everyone  feels  the  effects  of  it  the  first  time,  so  when  they  say  "It  doesn't  work",  and  they  continue  to  agree  with  the  government,  it  only  hurts  people  who  do  enjoy  using  it.    If  it  was  harmful,  then  why  do  so  many  intelligent  people  use  it?  The  founding  fathers  grew  it,  and  everyone  knows  about  Carl  Sagan.    Steve  Jobs,  Bill  Gates.      And  even  if  it  was  harmful,  how  can  anyone  tell  me  what  I  can  and  can't  put  into  my  own  body?  If  I  was  a  child,  I  would  understand,  but  I  think  I  can  research  this  stuff  on  my  own  well  enough  to  understand  what  marijuana  is  and  then  consume  it  without  guidance.    If  the  government  wants  to  interfere  in  my  life,  then  I  would  like  a  massive  research  grant  so  I  can  do  science  and  hopefully  improve  the  world  for  everyone.	0

Obama  is  a  pro-abortionist.  Killing  babies  is  wrong  so  stop  doing  it.  The  new  health  reform  bill  is  not  good.  There  are  some  good  things  but  more  worse  than  good.  You  could  have  just  passed  some  laws  instead  of  making  a  whole  bill.  People  are  retarted  for  agreeing  with  you.  Everyone  shouldnt  have  to  pay  for  health  care  because  they  might  not  be  able  to  pay  for  it  because  they  are  not  employed  aymore  because  their  jobs  are  shutting  down  because  they  need  to  pay  for  other  peoples  health  care.  Its  not  are  fault  if  some  girl  decides  to  go  and  have  unprotected  sex  and  end  up  pregnant  and  want  to  have  an  abortion.  They  should  have  to  still  have  the  baby.  They  should  not  have  other  people  pay  for  their  bills  because  they  are  young  and  have  no  job,  in  that  case  they  do  not  have  the  money  to  pay  for  it.  Then  it  will  raise  peoples  insurance  to  help  pay  for  peoples  hospital  bills.  Last  but  not  least  i  believe  marajuana  should  be  legalized  so  that  all  these  people  wont  be  going  to  jail  over  stupid  reasons  and  the  police  can  focus  on  the  more  important  things  to  stop  in  our  neighborhoods.[SEP]I  think  that  obama  is  a  good  choice!

Okay,  go  get  high  again,  hopefully  you  forget  this  site's  url.[SEP]Federal  regulation  of  health  care  should  be  limited  and  focused    For  example,  individuals  who  are  continuously  covered  for  a  specified  period  of  time  should  not  be  denied  access  to  insurance  because  of  pre-existing  conditions.    individuals  should  be  allowed  to  purchase  insurance  across  state  lines,  free  from  costly  state  benefit  requirements.    Finally,  individuals  and  small  businesses  should  be  allowed  to  form  purchasing  pools  to  lower  insurance  costs  and  improve  choice.    Regulation  can  correct  common  failures  in  insurance  markets,  but  it  is  often  counterproductive.    Regulation  places  a  burden  on  good  portions  of  the  economy,  not  just  bad  portions.    Regulations  function  as  a  hidden  tax.  The  federal  government’s  own  Small  Business  Administration  placing  the  price  tag  of  regulation  at  $1.75  trillion  annually—much  higher  than  the  entire  burden  of  individual  and  corporate  income  taxes  combined.    federal  agencies  today  have  near  plenary  power  to  issue  whatever  regulations  they  see  fit.  Though  most  are  nominally  controlled  by  the  president,  in  actual  practice  agencies  are  frequently  able  to  act  autonomously  with  little  or  no  presidential  oversight.  The  end  result  is  an  economy  subject  to  the  whims  of  unaccountable  bureaucrats  pursuing  their  own  agendas.  A  new  regulation  can  suddenly  transform  a  profitable  investment  into  an  unprofitable  one  or  render  employees  unproductive.  This  produces  uncertainty  with  all  its  attendant  economic  ills.    Just  because  we  have  the  worst  portions  of  the  market,  and  the  worst  portions  of  socialism  in  American  healthcare,  does  not  mean  we  need  to  go  towards  more  socialism...  These  countries  that  you  hold  up  as  models,  are  more  efficient  than  ours,  but  they  are  going  away  from  generous  social  programs,  because  they  are  going  broke...    You  point  out  that  these  other  countries  are  more  efficient,  but  Obamacare  increases  the  paperwork,  and  decreases  efficiency.  How  does  Obamacare  improve  things?[SEP]I  think  that  obama  is  a  good  choice!  Even  though  i  did  vote  for  mccain.  I  see  the  light  now!

If  the  idea  of  an  African-American  as  the  President  of  the  United  States  makes  you  uncomfortable  as  it  did  so  many  people,  you're  a  racist.[SEP]You  call  me  a  racist  based  on  my  political  ideals?    I  could  just  as  easily  call  you  an  anti-American  communist  who  only  supports  Obama  because  he    IS    half  black    NOTE:  my  apologies  i  did  not  see  my  previous  reply  so  i  concluded  it  was  not  completed,  i  will  mark  this  as  "none".[SEP]You  could.  But  that  would  be  flawed  just  like  the  rest  of  your  logic.[SEP]But  that  would  be  flawed  just  like  the  rest  of  your  logic.      I'm  assuming  you  voted  for  Obama  because  he's  half  black  as  you  have  no  other  argument  to  support  him.  And  in  that  case  your  logic  is  flawed  because  you  support  a  political  figure  due  to  the  way  he  looks.	1
Obama  is  doing  fine.  Hell,  I'll  vote  for  him  in  2012.  His  election  brought  a  lot  of  racists  out  of  the  woodwork  which  happens  to  include,  (big  surprise),  the  majority  of  the  Republican  Party.  Obama  isn't  the  next  Hitler.  If  you  think  so  then  you've  been  listening  to/watching  to  much  Glenn  Beck.  I  say  GObama.  (Go  +  Obama)[SEP]Yes,  and  while  "giving  it"  to  those  mean  racists  is  important,  I'm  afraid  I  have  to  tell  you  something  that  should  sadden  you  deeply:    The  country  is  in  ruins;  Barack  Obama  is    not    working.      Get  off  your  elitist  high  horse  and  face  reality.	1
I  think  that  obama  is  a  good  choice!  Even  though  i  did  vote  for  mccain.  I  see  the  light  now!  He  will  create  affordable  healthcare,  and  no  it  wont  be  government  healthcare!  And  he  is  focused  on  the  middle  class  as  well!  even  the  stimulus  bill  was  a  good  idea!	0
He  is  far  better  than  anything  the  RNC  has  put  forth.    He  represents  more  than  the  hope  of  change  for  a  nation,  but  the  desire  to  return  to  our  non-religious-super-zealotous  views  of  who  we  really  are  as  Americans.	0

I  am  glad  that  I  voted  for  Obama.  He  was  a  great  choice.  I'm  happy  that  we  finally  have  a  black  president!  He  deserved  that  position.  I  hope  that  the  anti-obamas  do  realize  that  if  he  fought  against  abortion  then  he  would  have  had  to  make  some  place  for  those  babies  to  go  if  the  parents  didn't  want  the  child.	0

And  actually  Obama  is  near  genius.  He  came  from  a  lower  middle  class  family,  yet  still  received  all  types  of  honors  all  throughout  school  and  in  Ivy  league  schools  no  less.  I'm  sure  his  IQ  is  at  least  double  that  of  you...  or  that  retard  anti-abortinists  put  in  office  last  time  Bush.  By  the  way,  how  did  Bush  do  with  that  making  abortion  illegal  thing?  I  forget...	0

Obama  was  not  a  good  choice.  I  can  only  give  him  credibility  when  he  can  guarantee  that  has  sat  down  and  read  all  1000+  pages  of  the  health  care  legislation  he  is  pushing  so  intently.  Only  when  a  politician  reaches  out  to  the  public  divulging  every  detail  of  how  legislation  will  work  and  can  then  explain  in  detail  how  any  random  citizen's  particular  situation  will  be  affected,  will  they  gain  my  respect.  Obama  has  not  done  this.  He  has  not  shown  any  effort  in  attempting  to  do  this.    He  is  no  more  than  a  professional  politician.  He,  just  like  any  other  politician,  was  elected  by  money  and  has  not  and  will  never  know  what  the  life  of  the  average  US  citizen  is  like.  Modern  politicians  are  completely  out  of  touch  with  the  average  American  and  therefore  cannot  begin  to  accurately  address  their  needs.    I  am  not  anti-democrat.  I  do  not  associate  with  any  party.  I  choose  to  ignore  the  "battles"  of  "party"  politics.    Personally...  it  makes  me  sick  when  the  news  and  media  portray  the  passing  of  a  piece  of  legislation  as  a  "victory"  for  one  party  or  the  other.    I  realize  I  may  have  grammar  issues  above.  I  don't  care.    If  I  could  add  a  second  tag  it  would  be  Anti  Professional  Politician,  but  for  the  sake  of  this  debate  Anti  Obama  will  do.	1

He  is  pushing  legislation,  which  is  different  from  advocating  any  specific  bill.  When  the  representatives  finish  debating  and  come  to  some  kind  of  concession,  a  bill  will  be  proposed  for  legislation,  voted  on  and  the  President    will  then    review  it,  sign  on  or  veto  it  for  another  round  of  debate.  It  would  be  pointless  for  the  President  to  read  all  of  the  bills  before  they  are  up  for  legislation.

Which  is  impossible  until  a  bill  has  been  finalized  and  voted  on  in  the  legislative  branch.  Until  then  there  are  no  details  of  "THE  bill"  to  plop  out.  Obama  so  far  has  been  doing  what  he's  supposed  to  be  doing:  talk  about  what  his  agenda  is  for  the  bill  that  is  being  debated  and  formed  in  the  legislature,  and  correcting  or  clarifying  misconceptions  about  what  is  being  proposed  by  his  administration.	0
Thinking  of  the  election  that  was  placed  you  either  had  to  choose  from  a  very  old  republican  canadiate  who  pretty  much  followed  the  steps  of  bush  which  probably  would  not  work.  Also  god  forbid  if  mccain  died  and  palin  was  president  thats  a  disaster.  On  the  other  hand  you  had  a  very  liberal  president  and  people  wanted  change  and  they  need  it.  But  now  Obama  is  now  president  and  the  media  settled  down  on  having  a  BLACK  president  (correction  half  black  no1  ever  picks  that  up)  implying  that  does  not  make  me  racist  only  aware.  Now  America  really  hasn't  all  and  all  changed.  The  Economy  sucks  still.  Unemployment  is  up.  Foreclosure  is  up.  I  mean  I  give  Obama  credit  he  has  good  ideas  but  they  suck  if  not  putting  them  to  action.  Also  Bush  lost  the  respect  of  many  foreign  countries.

And  every  president  since  Nixon  except  Bush  Jr  has  wanted  to  pass  a  healthcare  bill.  Every  single  one.

When  Obama  took  office  we  were  losing  on  average  700,000  jobs  per  month.  Now  we've  leveled  off  gaining  some  and  losing  some  month  to  month.  The  reason  Obama  has  not  done  as  much  as  he  wanted  is  because  since  he  took  office  Republicans  have  raped  the  filibuster  rule.  Prior  to  Obama  being  president  the  most  any  party  had  used  the  filibuster  in  the  history  of  the  Senate  in  one  year  was  around  a  hundred.  Last  year  Republicans  filibustered  over  200  times.  That  is  the  only  reason  he  hasn't  had  as  much  as  he  would  like  done.  That's  not  his  fault.    And  every  president  since  Nixon  except  Bush  Jr  has  wanted  to  pass  a  healthcare  bill.  Every  single  one.  Obama  has  been  the  only  President  able  to,  and  that  in  itself  is  going  to  put  him  on  par  with  some  great  presidents.  And  once  this  psychotic  tea  party  pout  fest  ends  and  republicans  come  to  their  senses  and  start  compromising  on  things,  he'll  be  able  to  bring  the  economy  the  rest  of  the  way  back  as  well.    Of  course  though  in  6  years  Republicans  will  just  elect  another  frat  boy  or  actor  to  ruin  all  the  hard  democratic  work  again  &gt;&lt;[SEP]When  Obama  took  office  we  were  losing  on  average  700,000  jobs  per  month.      The  economy  hit  the  trough  of  it's  business  cycle,  and  by  suggesting  Obama  stopped  the  downward  spike  has  no  truth.        Last  year  Republicans  filibustered  over  200  times.      Where  is  your  link  of  proof?      Of  course  though  in  6  years  Republicans  will  just  elect  another  frat  boy  or  actor  to  ruin  all  the  hard  democratic  work  again      Ronald  Reagan  had  to  clean  up  the  mess  after  Jimmy  Carter.    Bill  Clinton  wasn't  a  frat  boy.  He  admitted  to  the  use  of  marijuana  in  college.[SEP]The  economy  hit  the  trough  of  it's  business  cycle,  and  by  suggesting  Obama  stopped  the  downward  spike  has  no  truth.      Right  wingers  who  claim  to  be  independent  like  yourself  have  been  doing  this  for  decades.  When  the  economy  is  bad  when  it's  Regan  or  Bush  in  office  it's  a  business  cycle,  when  it's  Obama  or  Carter  it's  their  fault.      Where  is  your  link  of  proof?      Here's  a  great  article  on  the  unprecedented  obstruction  of  government    link      And  here  are  loads  of  stories  about  the  record  number  of  filibusters.  Google  either  "Republican  filibuster  2009  or  2010",  they  are  breaking  their  own  record    link        Ronald  Reagan  had  to  clean  up  the  mess  after  Jimmy  Carter.    Bill  Clinton  wasn't  a  frat  boy.  He  admitted  to  the  use  of  marijuana  in  college.          Ronald  Regan  was  the  first  to  triple  the  national  debt,  and  began  us  down  the  road  of  deregulation  which  is  the  primary  reason  we  today  are  in  such  a  deep  recession.  And  I  wasn't  talking  about  Clinton,  he  was  economically  perhaps  the  best  president  in  our  history,  Bush  Jr.  is  the  frat  boy.	0
I  am  anti-Obama.  I  am  not  racist,  nor  do  I  agree  with  the  comments  made  about  him  being  only  half  black.  However,  some  of  his  slogans  and  policies  worry  me.  National  healthcare  (and  I  know  that  this  is  overused)  is  a  good  example.  Government-run  banks  are  a  good  example.  Government-run  anything  that  was  privately  owned  before  Obama  came  to  office  is  a  good  example.  I'm  not  saying  that  he  is  going  to  be  the  one  that  sends  America  into  socialism.  He  may  be  a  fluke,  or  he  may  be  just  the  first  step  into  the  fears  of  the  majority  of  American  people.	1

I  think  that  obama  is  a  good  choice!  Even  though  i  did  vote  for  mccain.  I  see  the  light  now!  He  will  create  affordable  healthcare,  and  no  it  wont  be  government  healthcare!  And  he  is  focused  on  the  middle  class  as  well!  even  the  stimulus  bill  was  a  good  idea![SEP]Obama  is  another  Hitler.  There  is  not  an  ounce  of  capitalism  or  freedom  in  him.    Why  won't  anybody  in  the  media  talk  against  him?    Its  because  of  the  fairness  doctrine.  You're  not  allowed  to  speak  against  him.    Stop  listening  to  the  liberal  media.	1

Of  course  you  will,  after  all  it  was  his  fault  we  went  there  right...  oh  wait  he  was  one  of  the  few  senators  to  vote  against  the  war  to  start  with  &gt;&lt;    3.  True.  And  it  will  be  shown  if  anything  that  the  bill  should  have  gone  further.    4.  It  took  almost  10  years  to  pull  out  of  the  great  depression.  We  hit  the  peak  of  the  second  worst  recession  in  our  history  only  2  years  ago.    5.  The  vast  majority  of  people  do  not  vote  based  on  color,  and  just  as  many  people  would  automatically    not    vote  for  a  black  person  based  on  the  color  of  their  skin  as  they  would  for.  You're  logic  is  still  retarded.  Bill  Clinton  won,  he  was  a  democrat,  he  wasn't  black.  Jesse  Jackson  ran  once,  he    didn't    win,  he  is  black.  Only  those  obsessed  with  race  are  clueless  enough  to  actually  believe  race  had  anything  to  do  with  it.    6.  Hm,  I  would  say  judging  by  the  previous  president's  performance  compared  to  Bill  Clinton's  performance  that  it  is  the  Republicans  who  suddenly  show  up  for  elections  who  have  no  clue.    7.  Then  you  have  little  experience  in  the  matter.  I  for  example  seem  to  be  much  more  aware  of  this  sort  of  thing  and  I  voted  for  Obama.	0
If  McCain  were  also  young  and  black  he  would  be  siting  in  the  oval  office  right  now,  the  media  decided  that  election.[SEP]No,  if  McCain  were  young  and  black  he  never  would  have  been  elected  to  senate  in  Arizon  all  those  years  ago,  and  so  never  had  the  chance  to  run.  Besides  you  know  damn  well  that  a  black  person  cannot  win  a  Republican  primary...  least  you  should  know  that.    And  that  aside,  Obama  was  elected  because  he  had  a  better  message,  and  the  last  republican  president  sucked.  He  won  by  a  lot,  way  more  than  17%  and  you  realize  black  people  only  make  up  around  17%  of  the  population  right?    The  fact  is,  he  was  a  better  candidate,  and  the  reason  he  won  by  so  much  is  because  so  many  people  came  out  to  vote.  That's  just  a  fact.  Like  with  Clinton  before,  anytime  there  is  a  large  turn  out  the  democrat  wins,  because  the  democratic  platform  makes  more  sense  and  works  better  and  has  been  shown  to  work  better  historically,  and  when  you  get  the  non-politicals  excited  enough  about  voting  to  actually  look  at  issues  without  political  bias  they  vote  democratic.[SEP]And  that  aside,  Obama  was  elected  because  he  had  a  better  message,  and  the  last  republican  president  sucked.

I  think  that  obama  is  a  good  choice!  Even  though  i  did  vote  for  mccain.  I  see  the  light  now!  He  will  create  affordable  healthcare,  and  no  it  wont  be  government  healthcare!  And  he  is  focused  on  the  middle  class  as  well!  even  the  stimulus  bill  was  a  good  idea![SEP]Obama  is  another  Hitler.  There  is  not  an  ounce  of  capitalism  or  freedom  in  him.    Why  won't  anybody  in  the  media  talk  against  him?    Its  because  of  the  fairness  doctrine.  You're  not  allowed  to  speak  against  him.    Stop  listening  to  the  liberal  media.[SEP]Obama  is  another  Hitler.      So  what  you're  suggesting  is  that  president  Obama  believes  in    lebensraum  ,    volk  ,  the  supremacy  of  the  white,  Aryan  race,  and  Roman  architecture,  has  instituted  various  propaganda  institutions  geared  at  instigating  a  cult  of  youth,  accepts  that  eugenics  must  begin  in  order  to  purify  the  white  race,  believes  that  non-Germans  should  have  no  rights,  and  Jews  are  the  curse  of  the  world  leeching  off  of  the  German  people  and  is  shipping  them  off  to  ghettos,  and  then  concentration  camps  to  have  them  killed  in  the  millions?  Really?  Obama  is  another  Hitler?      There  is  not  an  ounce  of  capitalism  or  freedom  in  him.      Capitalism  hasn't  been  practiced  since  the  early  20th  century.  It  didn't  work  and  nobody  liked  it.      Why  won't  anybody  in  the  media  talk  against  him?      Faux  noose?      Its  because  of  the  fairness  doctrine.      The  fairness  doctrine  only  dictates  that  controversial  issues  need  honest  and  fair  coverage.      Stop  listening  to  the  liberal  media.      Yeah!  Next  thing  you're  going  to  do  is  tell  us  to  go  to  tea  party  rallies  where  we  can  talk  about  seceding  from  the  union  and  show  how  revolutionary  we  are  by  angrily  discussing  how  Fascist-Socialist-Communist  the  current  president  is!!!	0

It  takes  the  same  ignorance  to  say  that  the  recession  of  1920  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  war  ending  and  establishment  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  as  it  does  to  not  realize  the  previous  administration's  contribution  to  our  current  economic  predicament.    "On  March  4,  1921  President  Harding  assumed  office  while  the  nation  was  in  the  midst  of  a  postwar  economic  decline,  known  as  the  Depression  of  1920-21.  By  summer  of  his  first  year  in  office,  after  a  series  of  actions  by  the  Federal  Reserve  to  lower  interest  rates,  an  economic  recovery  was  underway.    After  the  recession  ,  starting  in  1922,  Harding  cut  taxes.  The  top  marginal  rate  was  reduced  annually  in  four  stages  from  73%  in  1921  to  25%  in  1925.  Taxes  were  cut  for  lower  incomes  starting  in  1923.  Despite  these  policies,  the  economy  entered  recession  in  May  1923  and  remained  in  recession  into  the  next  presidency,  through  July  1924.  Thomas  E.  Woods,  however,  contends  in  the  Fall  2009  issue  of  The  International  Review,  that  the  tax  cuts  implemented  by  President  Harding  ended  the  Depression  of  1920-21  and  were  responsible  for  creating  a  decade-long  expansion.  In  fact,  there  were  three  recessions  in  the  1920s  prior  to  the  Great  Depression  and  the  rate  of  recovery  was  slower  than  during  the  Great  Depression."	0
obama  is  pushing  socialism  like  you  wouldn't  believe.  obama  is  spending  more  than  you  know  how  to  count  up  to.  obama  is  a  bad  choice.  Who  cares  if  he  is  black.  That  is  not  the  issue.  obama  is  destroying  what  america  stands  for.	1
He  hasn't  really  done  much,  except  for  spend  money  that  we  don't  have  and  talk  a  lot.  In  fact,  I'd  say  he's  kind  of  like  a  real  housewife  of  NJ  because  he  loves  to  "shop"  and  talk.  ;)    And  yes,  I  can  say  that  because  I'm    from    NJ.  lol  just  kidding,  anyone  can  mock  them.	1
i  believed  him  obama  in  his  first  year  but  now  my  approvel  of  him  is  dropping	1
Obama  sucks  he  lead  the  usa  to  its  destruction.  Our  situation  is  worse  than  the  government  let's  us  know,  we  are  closer  to  WWIII  than  they  say  also	1
I  think  that  obama  is  a  good  choice!  Even  though  i  did  vote  for  mccain.  I  see  the  light  now!  He  will  create  affordable  healthcare,  and  no  it  wont  be  government  healthcare!  And  he  is  focused  on  the  middle  class  as  well!  even  the  stimulus  bill  was  a  good  idea![SEP]Obama  is  another  Hitler.  There  is  not  an  ounce  of  capitalism  or  freedom  in  him.    Why  won't  anybody  in  the  media  talk  against  him?    Its  because  of  the  fairness  doctrine.  You're  not  allowed  to  speak  against  him.    Stop  listening  to  the  liberal  media.[SEP]You  do  realize  that  you've  also  called  his  a  socialist,  right?  Fascism  and  socialism  are  on  opposite  sides  of  the  political  spectrum  Consistency  is  my  friend,  I  could  introduce  you  if  you'd  like!	0
At  first,  i  saw  Obama  as  a  good  choice.  He  seemed  to  know  what  he  was  talking  about,  and  made  some  good  proposals.  What  he  failed  to  do  however,  was  live  up  to  those  proposals.  After  claiming  he  was  going  to  shut  down  Guantanamo  Bay  (  which  contains  potentially  innocent  people)  years  later,  it  is  still  open  for  business.  I  think  this  sheds  light  on  the  man,  and  proves  that  he  is  no  more  like  the  next  man.  Simply  greedy  for  power.	1
Obama  hasn't  done  ANYTHING  to  help  this  country!  All  he's  done  this  entire  term  is  play  Nintendo  Wii  (as  much  as  I  love  video  games)  and  go  on  vacations!	1
Obama  is  a  liberal  black  socialist  and  the  media  will  not  speak  against  him  because  they  cater  to  the  blacks.He  wants  this  country  to  be  a  welfare  state.The  black  vote  will  go  his  way  because  they  would  rather  get  things  for  free  than  to  WORK!These  people  are  a  scourge  on  society  and  I  wish  they  would  quit  reproducing  their  filth.I'm  tired  of  paying  to  raise  them!	1

"  There  are  a  lot  of  wealthy,  successful  Americans  who  agree  with  me  —  because  they  want  to  give  something  back.  They  know  they  didn’t  —  look,  if  you’ve  been  successful,  you  didn’t  get  there  on  your  own.  You  didn’t  get  there  on  your  own.  I’m  always  struck  by  people  who  think,  well,  it  must  be  because  I  was  just  so  smart.  There  are  a  lot  of  smart  people  out  there.  It  must  be  because  I  worked  harder  than  everybody  else.  Let  me  tell  you  something  —  there  are  a  whole  bunch  of  hardworking  people  out  there.  (Applause.)    If  you  were  successful,  somebody  along  the  line  gave  you  some  help.  There  was  a  great  teacher  somewhere  in  your  life.  Somebody  helped  to  create  this  unbelievable  American  system  that  we  have  that  allowed  you  to  thrive.  Somebody  invested  in  roads  and  bridges.  If  you’ve  got  a  business  —  you  didn’t  build  that.  Somebody  else  made  that  happen.  The  Internet  didn’t  get  invented  on  its  own.  Government  research  created  the  Internet  so  that  all  the  companies  could  make  money  off  the  Internet.    The  point  is,  is  that  when  we  succeed,  we  succeed  because  of  our  individual  initiative,  but  also  because  we  do  things  together.  There  are  some  things,  just  like  fighting  fires,  we  don’t  do  on  our  own.  I  mean,  imagine  if  everybody  had  their  own  fire  service.  That  would  be  a  hard  way  to  organize  fighting  fires.    So  we  say  to  ourselves,  ever  since  the  founding  of  this  country,  you  know  what,  there  are  some  things  we  do  better  together.  That’s  how  we  funded  the  GI  Bill.  That’s  how  we  created  the  middle  class.  That’s  how  we  built  the  Golden  Gate  Bridge  or  the  Hoover  Dam.  That’s  how  we  invented  the  Internet.  That’s  how  we  sent  a  man  to  the  moon.  We  rise  or  fall  together  as  one  nation  and  as  one  people,  and  that’s  the  reason  I’m  running  for  President  —  because  I  still  believe  in  that  idea.  You’re  not  on  your  own,  we’re  in  this  together.  "    If  you've  got  it  in  your  head  that  it's  possible  to  be  prosperous  in  America  independent  of  public  help,  then  you're  deluded,  and  I've  got  no  time  for  indulging  delusional  people.  If  your  response  -  whether  it's  made  public  or  held  private  -  isn't  anything  but,  "I  made  a  mistake  in  quoting  Obama  out  of  context,"  I've  got  no  time  for  you  either.

I  wanted  to  believe  he  would  be  a  good  president,  but  he  is  likely  the  worst!  He  has  not  had  a  budget  in  3.5  years,  passes  illegal  legislation,  and  has  a  poor  policy  on  terror.    Damn,  I  wish  I  could  get  paid  like  he  does  to  suck  so  badly!	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	0

Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).

It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.

In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.

Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.

Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      Good  thing  that  that  article  said  that  the  entire  'comparing  debt'  idea  was  stupid,  and  that  they're  all  as  bad  as  each  other.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...      Of  course,  but  the  $700  billion  spent  on  stimulus,  increased  welfare  spending,  and  decreased  tax  revenue,  it  would  make  a  big  part  of  the  difference.      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      I  haven't  personally,  but  I  bet  if  you  compare  the  costs  of  conflicts  that  the  two  leaders  started,  you  would  see  a  massive  difference.  However,  yes,  I  agree,  Obama's  foreign  policy  is  not  perfect.  Part  of  why  I  have  repeatedly  claimed  that  he  is  simply  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      43  billion  is  not  a  small  amount,  and  yet  it  is  Republicans  who  continue  to  block  it.  This  is  not  Obama's  fault.      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      I  agree,  I  was  saying  I  don't  trust  him  because  of  what  happened  a  decade  ago.  And  Bush's  deregulation  (under  Ryan's  plan)  lead  to  the  market  crash  and  the  recession  we're  still  in.  Yes,  the  times  of  prosperity  were  good,  and  Bush's,  but  that  doesn't  mean  it  was  a  good  thing  overall.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.        http://www.newsmax.com/US/  Catholic-bishops-Ryan-budget/2012/04/17/                                                                              id/436184          http://thehill.com/blogs/  blog-briefing-room/news/  222003-catholic-bishops-criticize-ryan-  budget-cuts-to-food-stamps        And  yet  the  plan  you  support  feels  that  cutting  this    small  portion  of  government  spending    is  necessary  and  justified.  I'm  not  arguing  the  left  v  right  economic  perspectives,  I'm  simply  arguing  that  cutting  all  forms  of  social  support  will  hurt  more  those  who  need  it  the  most.  I  don't  see  why  that's  hard  to  accept.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.

I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]Good  thing  that  that  article  said  that  the  entire  'comparing  debt'  idea  was  stupid,  and  that  they're  all  as  bad  as  each  other.      That's  more  like  it,  recognizing  that  he's  not  such  a  Messiah  after  all.  That's  all  I  wanted.      Of  course,  but  the  $700  billion  spent  on  stimulus,  increased  welfare  spending,  and  decreased  tax  revenue,  it  would  make  a  big  part  of  the  difference.      Money  isn't  spent  on  less  taxing.  that  just  means  there  is  less  money  to  spend.    As  for  stimulus,  this  does  not  help  those  who  can't  help  themselves.  this  helps  keep  irresponsible  corporations  in  power.    And  increased  welfare  spending  is  not  the  answer,  as  LBJ  and  Nixon  have  shown.  Instead,  proposals  by  Bill  Clinton,  JFK,  and  Reagan  have  gotten  more  people  off  of  government  dependence  and  more  independent,  as  well  as  leaving  room  for  the  private  sector  to  increase  wealth  for  all  Americans  (as  it  historically  does).      Part  of  why  I  have  repeatedly  claimed  that  he  is  simply  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      If  the  bad  lot  doesn't  include  Ron  Paul  and  Gary  Johnson,  both  for  completely  ending  the  turmoil  in  the  Middle  East,  you'd  be  right.      43  billion  is  not  a  small  amount,        Not  compared  to  the  debt  and  massive  spending  that  it's  trying  to  quell        And  Bush's  deregulation  (under  Ryan's  plan)  lead  to  the  market  crash  and  the  recession  we're  still  in.      False.  Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie  Mae  were  irresponsible  in  their  rewards  to  banks  that  did  the  wrong  thing.  Subsidization  and  inflation  encouraged  the  banks  even  more  to  give  out  money  to  poor  people  who  can't  afford  to  give  it  back.  The  housing  market  regulators  focused  more  on  pushing  ideological  goals  than  thinking  about  what  could  actually  profit  the  housing  market.  In  fact,  the  housing  market  was  encouraged,  by  government  regulators,  to  over-supply  and  care  little  for  their  expenses  (after  all,  they  were  being  subsidized  to  an  atomic  level).  Bush  should  have  gotten  government  COMPLETELY  out  of  the  housing  market.  However,  this  wasn't  the  case,  and  folks  like    Ron  Paul    knew  this  would  happen.      but  that  doesn't  mean  it  was  a  good  thing  overall.      Clearly  Bush  should  have  listened  to    Ron  Paul    instead  of  the  ideologues  pushing  for  bigger  government.      necessary  and  justified.      based  on  the  assertions  of  Catholic  Bishops?    They  complain  more  about  the  subsidies  going  to  farmers,  which  is,  of  course,  wrong.  However,  Obama  is  not  eliminating  subsidies,  as  Ron  Paul  or  Gary  Johnson  would.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.

Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]That's  more  like  it,  recognizing  that  he's  not  such  a  Messiah  after  all.  That's  all  I  wanted.      Just  to  make  you  happy,  I  don't  really  like  Obama  that  much,  he's  failed  in  a  lot  of  aspects  that  I  thought  he'd  do  better,  drones  in  Pakistan  and  others,  hasn't  pushed  Republicans  far  enough  to  help  the  economy,  and  hasn't  done  shit  to  stop  everything  with  Iran.  I  also  remember  watching  a  2008  video  of  him  speaking  for  ending  the  war  on  weed,  yet  it's  only  gotten  worse,  from  what  I've  heard.  I  just  don't  like  people  calling  him  the  devil,  because  he  isn't.      Money  isn't  spent  on  less  taxing.  that  just  means  there  is  less  money  to  spend.      Debt  is  created  by  a  deficit.  Less  taxing  means  more  debt.      And  increased  welfare  spending  is  not  the  answer,  as  LBJ  and  Nixon  have  shown.  Instead,  proposals  by  Bill  Clinton,  JFK,  and  Reagan  have  gotten  more  people  off  of  government  dependence  and  more  independent,  as  well  as  leaving  room  for  the  private  sector  to  increase  wealth  for  all  Americans  (as  it  historically  does).      Increased  welfare  spending  was  mandatory,  it  takes  years  to  change  the  systems,  and  as  far  as  I'm  aware,  it  largely  falls  outside  of  his  mandate  (state  law,  not  federal,  I'd  assume?).      If  the  bad  lot  doesn't  include  Ron  Paul  and  Gary  Johnson,  both  for  completely  ending  the  turmoil  in  the  Middle  East,  you'd  be  right.      As  I've  said  before,  I  like  this  part  of  them,  but  disagree  with  others.  If  I  could  mix  and  match,  I  could  find  most  of  my  views  in  US  politicians,  I  just  can't  find  anyone  who  has  all  of  them  in  one.      Not  compared  to  the  debt  and  massive  spending  that  it's  trying  to  quell      Agreed.  Regardless,  he's  making  an  effort,  and  being  blocked  off,  for  no  real  reason.      False      Whilst  I  agree  that  there  was  a  large  extent  of  government  failure  after  deregulation,  were  there  not  deregulation  in  the  first  place,  there  would  not  have  been  the  opportunity  for  CBO's,  the  abuse  of  the  housing  market,  and  the  reckless  behaviour  that  you  described.  You  wish  to  completely  deregulate  the  banks?  This  seems  unwise,  bankers  operate  in  their  own  self  interest,  not  in  that  of  the  bank,  and  not  in  that  of  the  country.  Remember  that  the  heads  of  banks  who  brought  about  the  recession  got  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars,  that  sort  of  behaviour  would  only  become  more  common,  with  people  not  being  held  responsible  for  their  actions.      Based  on  the  assertions  of  Catholic  Bishops?      I  was  simply  using  them  as  an  example.  I  have  many  complaints  of  Republican  behaviour,  and  I  can  only  imagine  that  this  budget  is  just  more  of  the  same.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	0
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.

I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]yet  it's  only  gotten  worse,  from  what  I've  heard.      His  policies  on  the  War  on  Drugs  are  even  more  authoritarian  than  Bush's.      Less  taxing  means  more  debt.      But  it  is  not  spending,  which  actually  creates  debt.  Taxing  is  unnecessary  to  continue  spending.  Government  will  spend  as  much  as  it  wants  and  will  tax  people  as  much  as  they  want.  We  can't  just  say  "increase  taxes  to  reduce  debt"  when  the  debt  could  have  been  avoided  all  together.  Once  again,  it's  a  red  herring.      it  largely  falls  outside  of  his  mandate      Then  why  did  you  bring  it  up  in  the  first  place?    Bill  Clinton,  however,  signed  welfare  reform.  This  was  a  Federal  act.      I  like  this  part  of  them,  but  disagree  with  others      yet  you're  not  specific  on  how  their  economics  will  hurt  anyone.  You've  avoided  pointing  to  specific,  first  saying  "welfare  is  necessary"  and  then  saying  "well,  Obama  has  no  control  over  welfare."    Now,  economics  may  not  be  your  strong  suit  (it  was  once  something  i  hardly  considered),  but  if  you're  going  to  say  that  you  don't  like  their  economic  views,  you  should  be  more  specific  on  what  is  wrong  with  them.      Regardless,  he's  making  an  effort,  and  being  blocked  off,  for  no  real  reason      Not  according  to  the  evidence.  The  best  you've  got  is  that  Republicans  are  blocking  the  Buffet  rule,  even  though  I  already  described  how  the  Buffet  rule  is  a  "red  herring."      You  wish  to  completely  deregulate  the  banks?      It's  about  getting  government  away  from  the  banks  all  together.  The  banks,  how  they  currently  operate,  could  not  survive  without  government  involvement.  They  rely  on  subsidies,  standardized  currency,  human  controlled  inflation  and  regulation  to  keep  themselves  in  power.  Without  it  they  would  hold  little  power  over  our  wealth  and  currency.  Currently,  the  banks  dictate  most  money  powers.  They  will  continue  to  dictate  as  long  as  government  stays  involved  with  the  affairs  of  the  banks.  This  isn't  about  letting  the  large  trample  the  small,  it's  about  removing  the  power-source  for  this  monstrosity  that  government  created  in  the  first  place.  Big  government  is  the  problem  here,  not  lack  of  it.      bankers  operate  in  their  own  self  interest,  not  in  that  of  the  bank,  and  not  in  that  of  the  country.      A  bank  without  government  would  NEED  to  operate  in  the  interest  of  the  consumers  or  else  it  will  attract  none.  Currently  people  feel  that  they  need  banks.  While  the  privatization  of  banks  seemed  like  a  good  idea  during  the  transitional  period  between  Centralized  and  non-centralized  banks,  what  ended  up  happening  was  government  assisted  greedy  men.  You  can  not  expect  the  private  sector  to  do  what  it  does  best  if  government  is  still  involved,  as  it  always  has  been.  The  banks  are  protected  from  competitive  currency  because  they  hold  all  currency  rights.  The  banks  are  paid  by  governments  to  continue  being  banks,  which  removes  most  financial  liability  (especially  when  you're  large  enough  to  "need"  a  bailout).  And  the  banks  are  encouraged  by  leaders  (government  bureaucrats  like  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac)  to  make  poor  decisions  but  given  money  to  make  up  for  those  poor  decisions.  This  isn't  some  magical  imbecile  who  happens  to  be  running  a  bank,  this  is  a  guy  basically  being  given  money  to  make  poor  decisions  with  all  of  our  money.  It  was  inevitable  with  government  involvement,  as  Ron  Paul  accurately  predicted.      Remember  that  the  heads  of  banks  who  brought  about  the  recession  got  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars,  that  sort  of  behaviour  would  only  become  more  common,      Not  if  you  eliminate  government  involvement  in  the  banking  market.      I  was  simply  using  them  as  an  example.      A  terrible  one.      I  have  many  complaints  of  Republican  behaviour,  and  I  can  only  imagine  that  this  budget  is  just  more  of  the  same.      I'm  sure  you  do,  people  complain  a  lot.  The  importance  is  substance,  though.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]But  it  is  not  spending,  which  actually  creates  debt.      If  it's  a  red  herring,  and  irrelevant  to  the  economy,  then  are  you  saying  that  taxation  doesn't  matter?  Even  if  we  differ  in  defintions  of  debt,  and  money  flow,  it  has  the  same  effect  to  the  argument.      Then  why  did  you  bring  it  up  in  the  first  place?      I  brought  it  up  to  say  that  he  was  forced  to  pay  more,  it  was  mandatory.      But  if  you're  going  to  say  that  you  don't  like  their  economic  views      In  the  simplest  of  terms,  an  economic  system  is  simply  nothing  more  than  a  system  of  allocation  of  resources,  goods,  and  services.  Pure  capitalism  cares  only  about  the  number  of  dollars  you  will  put  towards  something.  As  there  is  not  equality  of  opportunity,  this  is  not  fair,  those  on  the  bottom  have  less,  and  not  only  from  their  own  actions.  Those  with  money  rule,  the  corporatism  we  have  seen  recently  within  US  politics  is  arguably  nothing  more  than  the  merging  of  politics  and  the  free  market.  Those  who  do  not  have  money  deserve  protection,  they  need  food,  water,  shelter,  and  other  similar  necessities.  Leaving  them  open  to  abuse  by  the  rich  is  not  what  I  think  should  happen,  and  that  is  what  Libertarians  would  do  -  leave  everyone  to  the  benefits,  and  abuse,  that  others  put  on  them  through  trade.    I  love  the  idea  of  people  being  completely  free  to  do  what  they  want  with  their  own  money,  their  own  time,  their  own  labour,  but  people  are  not  free,  they  are  forced  to  work,  they  need  an  income  to  survive.      Not  according  to  the  evidence.  The  best  you've  got  is  that  Republicans  are  blocking  the  Buffet  rule      Which  evidence?  I  seem  to  remember  you  posting  a  link  that  showed  that  Obama  is  being  blocked  from  increasing  any  taxes    (the  last  few  paragraphs)  .      It's  about  getting  government  away  from  the  banks  all  together.      Just  like  Iceland  did?  The  government  ended  sold  their  state  bank  about  ten  years  ago  I  believe,  outside  banks  came  in,  made  loads  of  money  for  a  while,  everyone  was  happy,  but  they  were  just  part  of  the  problem,  put  no  safeguards  in  place,  acted  recklessly,  and  were  destroyed  in  the  recession.  Now  the  prime  minister  is  being  put  onto  trial  for  gross  negligence  (the  only  head  of  state  to  be  formally  punished  as  part  of  the  recession).  It's  worth  remembering  that  the  banks  that  did  this  were  new  to  the  country  (all  but  one),  they  were  not  used  to  government  involvement.  They  simply  speculated,  loaned  out  money,  told  everyone  it  was  going  fine,  had  massive  rates  of  leverage,  and  then  it  all  fell  to  shit.    So  no,  I  don't  agree  that  deregulating  the  banks  is  a  good  idea,  either  economically,  or  from  a  humanitarian  sense  (banks  in  many  countries  now  refuse  to  lend  to  anyone  those  who  need  it,  because  they  see  it  as  'high  risk'.  I  understand  taking  a  harsher  tone  on  lending,  but  blocking  off  everyone,  without  considering  them,  is  bad  for  people.  They  now  only  lend  to  businesses  with  capital  to  pay  them  back  for  sure).      A  terrible  one.      I'm  sorry  I  trust  bishops  to  stand  up  for  the  poor,  it's  not  like  they  spend  their  life  following  a  doctrine  that  tells  them  to  do  exactly  that.    But  in  all  honesty,  I  haven't  read  around  it  too  much,  and  don't  have  time  to  do  so  now,  however,  it's  not  hard  to  find  criticisms  from  other  people  in  a  better  position  to  judge  it  than  me.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	0
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]then  are  you  saying  that  taxation  doesn't  matter?      It's  more  about  the  tyranny  behind  taxation.  In  the  terrible  shit-storm  that  government  has  created  thus  far,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  eliminate  most  taxes  today.  However,  we  should  be  progressing  past  the  need  for  taxation  all  together.  Create  a  new  system  dependent  on  proper  justification  for  spending  and  taxation  (if  necessary).    The  taxes  today  are  irresponsible  and  incomprehensible  by  average  Americans.  Many  people  have  to  pay  someone  just  so  they  don't  accidentally  miss  any  payments.  The  tax  bracket  is  better  now  than  it  has  been  at  times,  but  it  is  unrealistic.  Taxes  on  Capital  Gains  are  basically  taxing  the  same  income  twice.    Taxes  for  subsidizing  wheat  and  corn,  and  products  made  by  wheat  and  corn  are  taxed.  Most  states  have  sales  tax  asking  that  people  pay  the  government  if  they  wish  to  buy  an  item.  Taxes  on  property,  saying  that  you  can't  even  have  shelter  without  paying  the  government.    This  is  not  proper  and  it  is,  in  a  moral  sense,  evil.  The  idea  that  an  authority  figure  can  charge  you  for  buying  something  from  someone  else  is  kind  of  ridiculous,  yet  it  is  currently  the  case.    So  it's  not  so  wise  to  just  say  "yeah,  taxes  should  go  up  because  what  about  the  debt?"  The  debt  is  from  irresponsible  spending  from  the  government.  The  government  is  now  asking  us  to  pay  for  their  mistakes.  Furnishings  that  don't  even  benefit  most  of  us.  TJ  called  this  shit  tyrannical  for  a  reason.      Pure  capitalism  cares  only  about  the  number  of  dollars  you  will  put  towards  something.      The  number  of  dollars  and  the  strength  of  that  dollar  depends  heavily  on  government.  Higher  inflation  rates  and  higher  tax  rates  makes  business  more  desperate.  People  do  not  end  their  pursuit  of  profit  just  because  government  has  made  things  more  expensive  for  them.  They  will  simply  pass  the  expenses  unto  the  consumer,  as  we  have  seen  with  the  healthcare  and  agricultural  businesses.      As  there  is  not  equality  of  opportunity,  this  is  not  fair,  those  on  the  bottom  have  less,  and  not  only  from  their  own  actions.      As  shown,  historically  (as  I've  pointed  out  a  few  times  already),  private  endeavors  succeed  far  more  in  spreading  wealth  across  the  nation  than  public  efforts.  This  is  because  government  has  no  concern  for  efficiency.  While  welfare  and  social  services  may  be  for  noble  reasons,  they  have  been  unsuccessful  in  getting  people  out  of  the  slums.  Allowing  businesses  to  operate  unrestricted  creates  growth.  More  goods  and  services  are  provided  at  a  cheaper  rate  because  the  business  men  want  to  make  these  items  cheaply.  They  don't  want  expensive  items.  Expensive  items  mean  less  consumers.    As  well,  government  efforts  have  created  the  great  disproportion  of  wealth  (historically).  It  goes  all  the  way  back  to  the  bourgeoisie  and  we  see  it  today  with  the  monopolies  created  solely  by  government.  The  largest  of  corporations  owe  most  of  their  strength  to  government  regulations  and  restrictions  that  have  hurt  small  business,  subsidization  and  contracts  that  has  chosen  winners,  and  ridiculous  business  taxes  that  small  businesses  couldn't  keep  up  with.      Those  with  money  rule,  the  corporatism  we  have  seen  recently  within  US  politics  is  arguably  nothing  more  than  the  merging  of  politics  and  the  free  market.      The  "corporatist"  legislation  includes  major  regulations  on  the  market.  Government  should  not  have  the  power  to  put  such  restrictions  on  individuals,  yet  we  give  it  that  power  by  claims  of  non-trust  for  the  free  market.  Free  markets  is  very  far  from  corporatism.      Those  who  do  not  have  money  deserve  protection,  they  need  food,  water,  shelter,  and  other  similar  necessities.      Even  if  we  look  to  a  futuristic  utopia  where  the  Free  Market  has  prevailed  over  tyrannical  government,  government's  place  will  still  be  to  provide  basic  needs  (security,  vouchers  for  food  and  healthcare)  at  a  much  cheaper  and  efficient  rate.  However,  government  currently  is  a  bureaucratic  mess  and  the  only  defense  that  people  can  have  for  it  all  is  the  fear  of  an  alternative  that  has  never  done  harm  (in  fact,  'regression'  towards  free  markets  has  done  wonders  for  the  economies  of  the  USSR  and  China).    Vouchers  (like  food  stamps,  or  the  Paul  Ryan  healthcare  plan)  are  cheaper  and  allow  the  market  to  do  what  it  does  best,  compete  for  customers.  It's  a  system  of  welfare  that  is  efficient  and  I  have  no  problem  with  it.  That  is  currently,  however,  not  what  government  does.      I  love  the  idea  of  people  being  completely  free  to  do  what  they  want  with  their  own  money,  their  own  time,  their  own  labour,  but  people  are  not  free,  they  are  forced  to  work,  they  need  an  income  to  survive.      Hardly.  The  expense  of  most  food  industries  comes  from  heavy  regulation  and  taxation.  One  is  not  allowed  to  sell  food  without  going  through  months  of  expensive  protocol.  How  can  a  poor  person  in  a  poor  neighborhood  afford  to  do  that  or  keep  up  with  all  business  regulations  and  fees?  This  is  what  impoverishes  the  people  the  most.    A  neighborhood  is  unable  to  bring  in  resources  and  capital  because  government,  basically,  will  not  allow  them.      I  seem  to  remember  you  posting  a  link  that  showed  that  Obama  is  being  blocked  from  increasing  any  taxes      as  explained,  the  Buffet  Rule  is  a  "red  herring."      The  government  ended  sold  their  state  bank  about  ten  years  ago  I  believe,  outside  banks  came  in,  made  loads  of  money  for  a  while,  everyone  was  happy,  but  they  were  just  part  of  the  problem,  put  no  safeguards  in  place,  acted  recklessly,  and  were  destroyed  in  the  recession.      Way  to  leave  out  the  most  important  part.  When  the  recession  was  occurring,  the  Icelandic  government  PANICKED  and  made  drastic  action  believing  that  the  banks  wouldn't  be  able  to  handle  the  downfall  of  the  European  Union's  dollar  (the  EU  had  much  to  do  with  this,  sir).  Iceland  surrendered  ownership  of  their  banks  to  government  regulators  and  this  is  where  all  hell  broke  loose.  Now,  the  development  of  the  banks  was  already  a  fault  of  government,  as  government,  as  I  explained  before,  should  have  NOTHING  TO  DO  with  the  banks.  No  start  up  help,  no  subsidies,  no  regulations,  no  nothing.  Iceland  would  not  have  been  able  to  invest  so  much  power  into  three  banks  if  they  had  completely  avoided  that  market.  As  I've  stated,  it  is  better  to  either  have  a  Centralized  bank  or  no  government  involvement  with  banks  at  all.  I'd  choose  the  latter,  especially  today,  because  of  the  great  catastrophe  government  has  created  in  the  banking  and  currency  systems.      Now  the  prime  minister  is  being  put  onto  trial  for  gross  negligence  (the  only  head  of  state  to  be  formally  punished  as  part  of  the  recession).  It's  worth  remembering  that  the  banks  that  did  this  were  new  to  the  country  (all  but  one),  they  were  not  used  to  government  involvement      If  government  had  stayed  out  of  it  all  along,  none  of  this  would  have  been  an  issue.  Iceland  would  have  been  one  of  the  countries  to  avoid  the  mess  that  the  EU  and  US  created  with  their  meddling  in  the  private  sector.      (banks  in  many  countries  now  refuse  to  lend  to  anyone  those  who  need  it,  because  they  see  it  as  'high  risk'.  I  understand  taking  a  harsher  tone  on  lending,  but  blocking  off  everyone,  without  considering  them,  is  bad  for  people.      The  regulators  of  the  Fed  had  a  similar  position  as  yours,  and  this  is  why  the  housing  market  crashed.      They  now  only  lend  to  businesses  with  capital  to  pay  them  back  for  sure).      With  a  completely  private  sector,  why  would  this  be  a  problem  if  individuals  decide  to  do  business  with  whomever  they  please?  Is  it  government's  role  to  build  up  such  monstrous  corporations  only  to  try  and  tame  them  and  make  them  take  care  of  us  poor  folk  who  need  a  nanny  state?  I  find  it  quite  shaky  when  we  say  "hey  Frankenstein,  make  us  one  of  them  monsters  to  push  us  around."      I'm  sorry  I  trust  bishops  to  stand  up  for  the  poor,  it's  not  like  they  spend  their  life  following  a  doctrine  that  tells  them  to  do  exactly  that.      And  I  don't  trust  them  as  economic  advisers.  For  good  reason,  it's  not  very  good  to  give  the  religious  a  voice  in  politics.  But  that's  just  my  opinion.      it's  not  hard  to  find  criticisms  from  other  people  in  a  better  position  to  judge  it  than  me.      Sure,  but  saying  that  still  doesn't  make  a  difference  in  what  we're  talking  about.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
i  think  obama  is  a  liutral  wich  dosent  make  him  bad  but  obama  care  does  nothing  but  hurt  the  econimy	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]It's  more  about  the  tyranny  behind  taxation.      While  I  don't  disagree  that  taxes  do  need  a  justification  (which  I  feel  is  there,  but  am  currently  unable  to  provide  -  only  heard  of  Libertarianism  a  few  months  ago,  I'll  think  of  something),  in  terms  of  debt,  the  level  of  taxation  is  very  important.      This  is  not  proper  and  it  is,  in  a  moral  sense,  evil.      Is  it  not  (somewhat)  balanced  out  by  the  fact  that  the  money  is  (mostly)  spent  on  the  people?      The  number  of  dollars  and  the  strength  of  that  dollar  depends  heavily  on  government.      You  don't  get  what  I'm  saying  :(  My  issue  is  that  a  society  simply  based  on  the  value  to  which  each  person  provides  a  good  or  service  to  another  does  not  sound  like  a  utopia  to  me.  Obviously,  utopia  is  not  possible,  but  that's  something  that  I  like  about  socialistic  policies,  that  everyone  has  worth,  value,  and  deserves  equality.  The  value  or  number  of  dollars  has  little  do  with  that.      As  well,  government  efforts  have  created  the  great  disproportion  of  wealth  (historically).      I  disagree.  I  feel  that  taxes  or  no,  in  the  globalized  world  we  live  in,  economies  of  scale  has  such  an  advantage  that  they  are  able  to  push  people  out  of  business  with  ease.  Remember  that  countries  with  higher  tax  rates  tend  to  have  a  lower  wealth  inequality  rate  (Scandanavian  ones  come  to  mind).      Free  markets  is  very  far  from  corporatism.      I  meant  simply  in  the  way  that  people  spend  money  on  goods  or  services  that  they  wish  to  possess,  and  people  offer  them.  I  did  not  mean  that  corporatism  encouraged  the  free  market,  or  is  in  any  way  good.      It's  a  system  of  welfare  that  is  efficient  and  I  have  no  problem  with  it.      The  Ryan  plan  calls  for  little  reform  (as  far  as  I  am  aware,  feel  free  to  call  me  out  on  that  if  I  am  wrong),  but  simply  cuts  people  from  government  provision  to  save  money.      A  neighborhood  is  unable  to  bring  in  resources  and  capital  because  government,  basically,  will  not  allow  them.      I  agree  that  this  is  a  major  problem,  I  have  many  complaints  for  the  current  government  (Obama  included,  this  started  off  as  me  defending  his  impact  on  debt),  and  over-regulation  is  one  of  them.      as  explained,  the  Buffet  Rule  is  a  "red  herring."      There  is  much  more  to  the  tax  debate  than  the  Buffet  Rule.  Your  article  claimed  that  he  was  unable  to  raise  taxes  on  the  rich  in  anyway,  pushing  millionaires'  taxes  to  30%  is  only  part  of  it.      Way  to  leave  out  the  most  important  part.      The  banks  damage  was  done  at  that  point,  one  bank  went  into  voluntary  administration  before  it  was  taken  over.  So  no,  I  don't  feel  that  the  government  was  the  cause  of  the  crash,  the  high  risk,  over-leveraged,  under-regulated  banking  bubble  was  the  cause  of  the  Icelandic  crash.      The  regulators  of  the  Fed  had  a  similar  position  as  yours,  and  this  is  why  the  housing  market  crashed.      The  housing  market  crashed  because  of  banks,  CDO's  &  derivatives,  pretending  high  risk  options  were  completely  safe,  and  frivolously  acting  bankers.    Out  of  interest,  why  do  you  feel  that  regulators  have  a  responsibility  to  see  these  sort  of  things,  if  you  are  against  them?      With  a  completely  private  sector,  why  would  this  be  a  problem  if  individuals  decide  to  do  business  with  whomever  they  please?      Funny  how  you  talk  about  how  government  hurts  small  businesses,  then  defend  corporations  actions  which  do  the  same.      And  I  don't  trust  them  as  economic  advisers.      An  economy  is  nothing  but  a  system  of  allocation  of  resources  to  fulfill  the  needs  and  wants  of  society.  I  trust  them  to  say  when  the  system  would  not  meet  needs  and  wants  adequately.  I  would  not  trust  them  to  suggest  an  alternative  system,  just  as  I  would  never  presume  to  do  the  same,  but  the  commentary  they  provide  is  not  worthless.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.

If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	0
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]in  terms  of  debt,  the  level  of  taxation  is  very  important.      Bill  Clinton  had  a  different  view  on  things.  It  was  about  having  taxes  that  can  match  the  spending.  However,  if  spending  is  out  of  control,  increasing  taxes  doesn't  help.  this  is  why  Clinton  cut  spending  so  much  that  taxes  could  actually  be  cut  instead  of  needing  any  raise,  while  still  having  an  annual  surplus.      My  issue  is  that  a  society  simply  based  on  the  value  to  which  each  person  provides  a  good  or  service  to  another  does  not  sound  like  a  utopia  to  me.      You're  ignoring  some  of  my  points  on  a  voucher  program,  but  even  so,  it  makes  little  sense  to  reward  others  for  doing  nothing.  As  well,  as  explained,  government  services  provide  a  lot  less  to  the  public  than  private  services.  This  is  simply  because  pursuit  of  wealth  increases  overall  wealth.  People  have  more  in  Capitalistic  countries  than  in  Collectivist  countries.  This  is  what  the  USSR  witnessed  when  they  privatized  more  industries,  and  this  was  the  BIGGEST  realization  for  China  as  they  went  from  Communist  to  practically  Laissez-Faire  economics.          Obviously,  utopia  is  not  possible,  but  that's  something  that  I  like  about  socialistic  policies,  that  everyone  has  worth,  value,  and  deserves  equality.      Socialistic  policies  do  not  increase  the  amount  of  goods  and  services  available  to  people  (unless  you  include  Militaristic  policies  that  have  been  the  only  historical  instance  where  massive  government  spending  has  actually  benefited  the  citizens  in  in  their  wants).  Food  and  clean  water  supply  goes  up  with  private  industries'  efforts  to  make  more  money.  Consumers  want  goods  and  services,  private  forces  provide  them.    If  you're  worried  about  the  poor,  a  voucher  program  (that  would  cut  down  spending  and  regulation  greatly)  would  benefit  them  far  more  than  a  public  service.  Vouchers  would  give  them  the  ability  to  choose  at  little  to  no  cost  to  themselves.  However,  socialistic  policies  of  government  services  and  regulation  only  make  things  harder  for  the  poor.      Remember  that  countries  with  higher  tax  rates  tend  to  have  a  lower  wealth  inequality  rate  (Scandanavian  ones  come  to  mind).      I've  given  my  explanation  on  Scandanavia  and  PrayerFails  has  given  a  different  but  also  effective  one  as  well.  Wealth  equality  doesn't  mean  jack  shit  if  the  overall  wealth  is  still  low.      The  Ryan  plan  calls  for  little  reform      The  current  Ryan  plan  is  to  appeal  to  the  Mainstream  Democrats  who  hated  his  voucher  program  for  healthcare.      over-regulation  is  one  of  them      general  regulation  does  this.  Unless  you  mean  regulation  ONLY  in  rich  neighborhoods...        The  housing  market  crashed  because  of  banks,  CDO's  &  derivatives,  pretending  high  risk  options  were  completely  safe,  and  frivolously  acting  bankers.      It  came  from  government  incentives  to  "look  out  for  the  poor"  who  were  actually  the  risky  loans.  It  came  from  government  taxes  on  businesses  that  didn't  make  these  high  risks.        Out  of  interest,  why  do  you  feel  that  regulators  have  a  responsibility  to  see  these  sort  of  things,  if  you  are  against  them?      I  feel  that  you  completely  ignored  my  points  that  regulators  should  have  no  say  in  any  of  the  business  of  the  banks,  and  that  general  government  should  give  absolutely  no  rewards  to  banks  for  any  reasons.  No  subsidies,  no  tax  incentives,  no  regulation,  no  interest  fondling,  and  no  bail-outs.  Government  should  view  banks  as  another  business  and  should  have  no  concern  for  them.  This  will  remove  their  power  over  all  of  us  who  depend  greatly  on  government  currency  yet  require  private  industries  to  provide  us  with  this  government  provision.      Funny  how  you  talk  about  how  government  hurts  small  businesses,  then  defend  corporations  actions  which  do  the  same.      Explain.      I  trust  them  to  say  when  the  system  would  not  meet  needs  and  wants  adequately.      Why?  forgive  me,  but  this  may  just  be  my  issue  with  debate  in  general,  when  others  look  to  their  pastors  and  school  teachers  as  experts  on  very  complex  issues  (especially  to  justify  the  surrendering  of  liberty  for  the  sake  of  security  that  has  never  been  shown  to  exist  or  be  successful).      but  the  commentary  they  provide  is  not  worthless.      To  you,  maybe.  To  me,  it  is  very  worthless.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.

The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]Btw,  I  want  your  opinion  on  something.  I  live  in  Qatar,  which  has  a  large  government  sector,  mostly  in  banking  and  petroleum.  This  generates  a  massive  portion  of  its  GDP,  over  60%,  and  it  therefore  charges  minimum  levels  of  tax.  My  parents  only  pay  import  tax,  no  VAT,  no  income  tax,  and  massive  subsidies  on  energy  (petrol  &  electric).    The  government  spends  billions  trying  to  improve  the  country,  ensure  long  term  financial  stability,  building  infrastructure,  maintaining  culture,  and  provides  its  national  citizens  with  the  most  extensive  benefits  system  in  the  world  (most  nationals  get  about  $1  million  throughout  their  life,  if  they're  born  today).    Is  this  government  bad?[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).

He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."

I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]As  for  Qatar,  it  seems  that  you're  living  under  an  oil  company  and  not  an  actual  country  like  the  United  States.    If  the  USA  could  be  as  small  and  focused  on  one  cash  crop,  sure,  things  would  be  better.    But  to  believe  that  Qatar  is  the  way  it  is  because  of  anything  but  the  fact  that  Oil  is  one  of  the  most  highest  demanded  products  on  the  planet  is  really...  a  misunderstanding  of  economics.    300,000  people  under  an  absolute  monarchy  that  has  possession  of  one  of  the  largest  oil  supplies  is  pretty  much  nothing  compared  to  the  USA,  which  is  above  300,000,00  people  and  has  a  very  mixed  set  of  resources.      That's  like  living  in  a  city  that  shits  gold  and  then  saying  "see,  why  can't  you  be  like  us?"[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	0
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]I  think  you  misunderstood  what  I  was  asking.  I'm  not  asking  if  this  model  can  be  exported  around  the  world,  I'm  far  from  naive.  I  was  simply  asking  your  opinion  on  what  the  government  does,  as  a  Libertarian.  Considering  much  of  what  you  complain  about  is  the  economic  aspect  -  government  takes  your  money  &  fucks  up  the  economy  -  since  all  the  Qatari  government  does  is  inject  money  into  the  system  &#40;money  from  oil,  which  a  private  company  could  have  got,  granted&#41;,  I  was  wondering  how  you  felt  about  it.    Essentially,  whether  you're  a  pragmatic  Libertarian,  or  purely  principled.  Just  out  of  interest.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.

We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]As  a  human  being  with  the  ability  to  reason,  I'm  very  much  against  this  model.    Qatar  is  depending  greatly  on  totalitarianism  and  oil.  A  simple  drop  in  demand  for  oil  will  destroy  your  country.  Under  a  Free  Market,  companies  will  work  to  meet  demand.  But  with  a  government  that  hogs  the  oil  reserves  while  depending  on  their  supply,  they  have  created  little  room  for  free  trade.  It's  either  Oil,  or  you're  all  screwed.    So  really,  even  that's  pretty  bad.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	0
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.

He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."

I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]They  may  be  dependent  on  petroleum  products,  but  their  main  export  is  LNG,  not  oil.  LNG  is  used  in  energy  production,  as  well  as  in  some  cars,  and  its  demand  &  price  fluctuates  much  less  than  oil  does.  For  example,  Qatar  produces  over  95%  of  UK  oil,  and  demand  is  only  predicted  to  increase.  They've  made  attempts  to  diversify  their  income  (they've  learnt  from  Dubai),  and  have  one  of  the  biggest  banking  sectors  in  the  region,  and  huge  infrastructure  plans.    They  also  allow  a  free  market  to  a  reasonable  extent  -  both  Shell  and  Exxon  make  billions  there,  and  there  is  a  significant  number  of  foreign  companies  in  the  country.    And,  could  I  say  that  your  main  justification  for  no  government  is  simply  economic,  rather  than  social?[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.  I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
The  first  article  is  not  false?  Why  then,  why  I  search  the  authors  name  in  Google,  do  I  see,  on  the  first  page,  two  articles  specifically  stating  that  he's  wrong  when  it  comes  to  debt  +  Obama?  Links:    1    &    2      I  liked  your  second  article  more,  it  seemed  less  biased,  and  it  did  raise  two  good  points.  First  of  all,  Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession,  government  spending  should  counter  the  business  cycle.  Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have,  whilst  Obama  had  the  biggest  recession  in  modern  history.  To  get  back  to  your  original  point,  of  how  Obama  has  increased  debt  more  than  any  other  president,  I  was  simply  pointing  out  that  it's  hardly  a  fair  comparison.    Second  of  all,  Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.  Again,  it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'  when  the  results  you  are  using  against  him  are  not  of  his  own  making.    But,  as  I  said  originally,  I  don't  think  Obama  deserves  all  of  the  love  that  he  gets  from  the  'Left'/liberals/democrats,  whatever  you  want  to  call  them.  He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.  I  remember  looking  through  the  official  comparisons  of  the  various  candidates  economic  projections,  and  yes,  it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.  The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help,  and  this  is  where  I  feel  that  Obama  does  well,  and  the  Republicans  do  neither.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      Obama  is  supposed  to  spend  more  in  a  recession      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      Bush  had  no  real  reason  to  continue  the  deficit  in  the  way  that  he  should  have      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.        Obama's  tried  to  increase  tax  on  the  upper  classes,  and  the  corporations,  and  been  blocked  by  Republicans.      Obama    supports    the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.      it's  hardly  fair  to  call  him  'the  worst  president  ever'      I  already  pointed  out  that  that  title  belongs  to  Jimmy  Carter.      He  is  currently  the  best  of  a  bad  lot.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.  And  if  Romney  were  to  use  Ryan's  earlier  plans,  healthcare  would  be  solved  and  spending  would  be  moderately  decreased  even  more.  However,  the  Ryan  plan  is  not  as  good  as  it  SHOULD  be.      it  is  true  that  Ron  Pauls  cut  the  deficit  most  quickly,  and  therefore  debt,  but  it  did  so  at  the  expense  of  the  economy.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.  Federal  spending  and  regulation  is  what  got  us  here  in  the  first  place.  The  War  on  Drugs,  the  War  on  Terror,  the  Federal  Reserve,  etc.  Obama  is  just  another  politician  with  the  same  BS  that  Bush  brought  us.  The  idea  that  people  truly  believe  him  to  be  a  candidate  of  "change"  is,  at  times,  frustrating.        The  Libertarians  look  to  'save'  the  economy,  but  at  the  expense  of  the  people  who  it  is  supposed  to  help      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps."  Federal  manipulation  of  the  economy  has  only  led  us  to  here.  Once  again,  the  problem  is  big  government.  We  put  so  much  faith  into  a  group  of  people  who  think  that  manipulation  and  control  of  free  individuals  is  the  answer.  It's  a  hegemony  of  slavery.[SEP]Those  two  links  don't  say  that  he's  lying,  they  say  that  he's  misrepresenting  information...  which  as  my  second  link  shows  is  the  case  for  both  knoller  and  the  people  who  attack  Knoller.      They  speak  against  the  validness  of  the  article,  and  portray  good  arguments.  Considering  there  is  a  lot  of  problems  with  the  sources  of  information  in  regards  to  this  issue,  I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Keynsian  economics  is  not  the  consensus.  Many  believe  that  increased  spending  is  never  a  good  idea,  especially  under  a  recession.  Letting  the  largest  of  corporations  fail  is  not  only  supported  by  Right  Wing  economists  but  by  even  some  of  the  Left-Wing  revolutionaries  (Occupy  Wall  Street).      I'm  not  even  talking  about  how  to  get  out  of  a  recession,  I'm  talking  about  the  very  necessities  of  his  office.  In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.  And  I  have  no  one  argue  that  government  spending  should  be  high  in  a  boom,  such  as  Bush  did,  the  second  highest  debt  creator.      Bush  had  reasons,  including  the  War  and  humanitarian  aid  for  Africa  and  India  (yeah...  people  forget  about  that  part  for  some  weird  reason).  I  disagree  with  Bush's  fiscal  policies  as  well  as  Obama's.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,  and  considering  the  flaky  reasons  for  it,  I  do  not  give  him  any  relapse  on  the  trillions  it  cost.  Considering  the  US'  abysmal  foreign  aid  (as  a  percentage  of  national  income)  history,  its  effects  are  miniscule  on  such  large  amounts  of  money.      Obama  supports  the  Bush  tax  cuts.  He  did  not  try  to  end  them  in  any  way.        He  said  he  would  not  have  signed  the  bill  if  it  did  not  include  "other  extensions  of  relief  that  were  also  set  to  expire."  Among  other  provisions,  he  cited  the  extensions  of  unemployment  benefits  and  tuition  tax  credits,  as  well  as  new  tax  incentives  for  businesses.    Obama  acknowledged  that  "there  are  some  elements  of  this  legislation  that  I  don't  like,"  and  some  that  congressional  Republicans  and  Democrats  don't  like.  "That's  the  nature  of  compromise,  yielding  on  something  each  of  us  cares  about  to  move  forward  on  what  all  of  us  care  about,"  he  said.  "And  right  now,  what  all  of  us  care  about  is  growing  the  American  economy  and  creating  jobs  for  the  American  people."      But  yes,  I'll  concede,  I  wasn't  aware  of  that.  However,  considering  the  whole  Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Even  Romney  wishes  to  use  the  Ryan  plan,  which  would  save  AT  LEAST  5  trillion  dollars.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession  (yes,  he  designed  Bush's  budget  too).  Considering  the  widespread  criticism  of  his  plan,  I  would  hesitate  before  supporting  it,  yet  alone  attaching  such  massive  claims  to  it.      It's  not  just  about  cutting  spending,  Ron  Paul  wishes  to  eliminate  most  Federal  powers  that  keep  our  economy  at  a  stranglehold.      This  is  what  annoys  me  about  Ron  Paul.  Some  of  his  policies  are  fantastic,  ending  the  war  on  drugs/terror,  all  that  bullshit,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.  But,  that's  unrelated.      How  are  they  hurting  the  people  it  "helps".      Social  support  is  supposed  to  help  those  who  need  it  the  most.  Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.[SEP]I  feel  it  is  relevant  to  point  out  misinformation  where  it  is  apparent.      Good  thing  I  provided  the  second  link  to  show  how  it's  still  relevant.      In  a  recession,  were  millions  become  unemployed,  he  has  to  pay  billions  more  than  anyone  else  in  the  history  of  US  presidents  just  in  unemployment  benefits,  keeping  the  people  alive.      Even  if  you  want  to  use  the  expense  of  welfare  argument,  that  is  not  NEARLY  the  amount  that  went  up  in  spending  under  the  Obama  administration.  Unless  Corporate  welfare  counts...    As  well,  Military  spending  and  increased  subsidies  for  various  businesses.  And  continued  Bank  support,  provisions  for  various  organizations.  More  importantly,  the  unnecessary  welfare  spending  that  continues  to  rise  but  provide  no  benefit  but  only  to  create  government  dependence.    All  of  this  at  the  expense  of  small  businesses  that  try  to  compete  with  large  businesses  in  a  heavily  regulated  market.      The  war  was  his  choice  to  enter,      One  that  Obama  continues,  and  even  expanded  by  bombing  Libya  and  progressing  the  disaster  in  Pakistan.      Buffet  tax  debate  (estimated  to  save  47  billion  by  2022),  I  would  disagree.      Which  will  do  practically  nothing  to  cover  the  costs  that  he  continues  to  spike.  It's  a  red  herring.      Ryan's  plans  were  the  ones  that  led  to  this  recession      I  was  referring  to  his  proposal  on  Healthcare,  not  something  a  decade  ago  (that  actually  also  led  to  economic  prosperity.  If  it  wasn't  for  the  war,  Bush  would  have  a  much  better  legacy  in  economics).      he  applies  his  unconventional  ideals  to  everything,  and  it  would  just  be  a  bad  thing  overall.      His  ideas  are  consistent  and  rational.  the're  based  on  expanding  wealth  and  diminishing  most  government  powers  that  have  put  us  here  in  the  first  place.  People  seem  to  act  like  government  is  so  important  that  it's  okay  to  allow  it  to  choose  winners  and  losers  (as  it  has  done  through  regulations  and  restrictions).  Ron  Paul  and  other  Libertarian  thinkers  believe  that  individuals  benefit  the  most  when  they  have  choice  over  what  to  do  with  their  own  property.      Reducing  spending  on  social  support,  and  taxation,  increases  inequality,  and  disproportionately  affects  the  poor.      Is  this  why  welfare  reform  resulted  in  economic  prosperity?  Is  this  why  FDR  almost  made  the  Depression  worse  until  the  War  started?    If  there  is  any  kind  of  spending  that  has  ever  helped  economy  and  the  prosperity  of  citizens  it  has  historically  been  Military  Spending.  Yet  that  is  one  of  the  MANY  things  that  government  has  boosted  its  spending  in,  and  even  so,  just  because  military  has  been  successful  in  the  past  doesn't  mean  that  it's  the  only  way.      Even  so,  helping  those  who  truly  can't  help  themselves  is  still  a  small  portion  of  government  spending.    edit:  The  Soviet  Union  had  industrial  progression,  but  this  was  also,  technically,  military  spending.  As  for  their  agriculture,  27%  of  the  food  provided  for  the  people  was  from  private  farm  owners,  even  though  they  took  up  1%  of  the  total  agricultural  community  of  Russia.    Historically,  as  we  see,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  privatization,  no  with  government  welfare.    I  agree  that  some  welfare  may  still  be  necessary  for  those  who  need  it  most,  but  at  the  rate  it  is  now  (and  how  both  Obama  and  Romney  want  to  continue  it)  is  not  going  to  help  increase  the  standard  of  living.[SEP]your  clarifications  aren't  showing  in  my  argument  feed.  but  anyway,  it's  no  doubt  that  Qatar  is  doing  quite  well.  I've  already  said  that.  However,  an  entire  social  and  economic  system  to  be  dependent  on  government  exports  is  kind  of  the  point  that  I  was  making.  Qatar  has  to  run  itself  like  a  business  to  keep  its  employees  (citizens)  happy  and  working  for  the  government.  And  it  is  not  a  free  market  just  because  it  pulls  in  Capital  (Hitler  pulled  in  Capital  but  delegated  most  of  the  citizens  to  work  for  militarist  goals).    Shell  and  Exxon  make  billions  because  of  Globalization.  Not  because  Qatar  allows  "free  markets."    And  the  social  aspect  has  much  to  do  with  with  my  justification  for  little  (not  no)  government.  A  social  system  with  a  terrible  economic  system  is  not  a  good  social  system.  People  will  have  little  access  to  goods  and  services  of  better  quality  if  the  private  sector  is  limited  and  heavily  regulated.  As  explained  in  my  many  posts  before,  overall  wealth  goes  up  with  the  pursuits  of  the  private  sector.  This  has  been  evident  in  transitional  periods  for  the  Soviet  Union  and  China,  which  portray  the  greatest  examples  of  binaries  in  their  economics.    Society  benefits  when  they  are  free  to  trade  with  each  other  and  when  they  are  free  to  compete  for  consumers.  When  free  trade  is  restricted,  people  will  never  be  able  to  get  the  goods  and  services  that  they  need  (unless  you  restrict  the  population  itself).[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.

Seriously?  Bush  raised  the  debt  by  two  BILLION  for  the  wars  (BOTH  OF  THEM)  Obama  has  outspent  that  in  a  week.  Learn  the  truth[SEP]God  I  love  idiots  sometimes.    The  wars  that  Bush  started  cost  about  3    trillion    dollars  alone.  This  money  was  essentially  wasted,  in  terms  of  the  American  economy.  He  also  threw  away  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  in  tax  cuts  (mainly  for  the  rich),  as  well  as  deregulating  the  banks,  causing  them  to  rapidly  spiral  their  risks,  into  what  we  now  call  'a  great  big  fucking  recession'.  Considering  that  he  started  off  with  a  budget  surplus,  I  hardly  consider  this  a  good  record.    Then,  you  look  at  Obama.  He's  cut  back  on  military  spending,  partially  through  removing  troops  from  around  the  world  (saving  lives),  as  well  as  through  straight  cuts.  In  his  first  year,  spending  fell  -  overall  spending  growth  in  4  years  is  lower  than  the  inflation  rate  (0.4%).  Obama  is  spending  essentially  the  same  amount  as  Bush  did  at  the  end  of  his  presidency.  However,  due  to  a  fucked  economy,  tax  revenues  have  fallen  massively,  and  government  non-discretionary  spending  has  risen  (due  to  increased  welfare  payments).    So  no,  that's  patently  wrong.  Please  learn  a  little  more  before  spittling  off  indoctrinated  bullshit.[SEP]He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.[SEP]I  don't  deny  that  Obama  isn't  amazing  (I  only  support  him  now  as  the  best  of  a  bad  lot),  but  with  the  debt,  that's  hardly  the  most  accurate  way  of  looking  at  it.    While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.

Wilson  was  pretty  bad,  and  so  was  Buchanan.  Carter  gives  Obama  a  good  run  for  his  money  (or  should  I  say  other  people's  money)  but  I  have  to  say  Obama  is  without  a  doubt  the  worst,  most  spendthrift,  most  disengaged,  incompetent  and  inept  President  I've  ever  seen.  An  outstanding  stump  politician,  but  completely  devoid  of  leadership  skills.	1

First  let  me  say  that  I  am  slowly  getting  the  impression  that  this  is  a  site  for  kids  and  young  adults.  Some  of  the  answers,  and  definitely  a  lot  of  the  spelling  and  grammar  indicate  as  much.  So  I  realize  now  that  I  must  take  some  of  these  debates  with  a  grain  of  salt.    Having  said  that,  this  is  what  I  say  to  people  when  they  say  that  a  particular  President  was  the  worst.  In  your  adult  life  assess  your  economic  standing  under  every  President.  Figure  out  which  negative  economic  phases  are  attributed  to  yourself  and  which  ones  were  caused  by  government  forces.  Of  the  ones  caused  by  government  forces,  separate  those  caused  by  your  state,  and  the  federal  government.  Of  the  one(s)  caused  by  the  federal  government,  how  many  were  caused  by  direct  government  legislation  (do  your  thorough  research)?    I  can  continue  on,  because  of  a  two  house  congress,  and  stubborn  party  affiliations,  but  I  am  guessing,  that  most  of  the  bad  stuff  in  your  life  is  YOUR  own  fault,  not  the  fault  of  federal  laws.  Human  beings,  especially  in  America,  love  to  point  fingers  and  blame  every  one  else  for  our  screw  ups.  Your  life  is  screwed  up  and  the  President  (whose  only  been  in  office  for  3  years)  is  the  cause?    Reassess  when  your  life  began  to  plummet,  I  think  you  will  find  that  it  goes  back  farther  than  3  years.	0

You're  not  going  to  get  banned  for  saying  something  edgy  (or  even  REALLY  edgy).  You  won't  get  banned  if  you  didn't  match  a  criteria.  Instead,  a  creator  of  a  specific  debate  can  restrict  your  participation  from  within  that  specific  debate  if  they  feel  that  you  are  being  improper  in  the  format.      Once  again,  user  based.  More  freedom,  but  with  more  liberty  comes  less  security  (in  this  case,  annoying  users).	1
That's  odd.  I  seem  to  remember  a  man  named  "Bush"?  No?  Oh,  I'm  just  going  crazy,  aren't  I?	0

President  Obama  is  most  definitely  not  the  worst.  My  vote,  at  least  for  modern  Presidents,  is  definitely  for  Bush  Jr.  He  is  responsible  for  setting  the  U.S.  back  further  than  anyone  else.  Obama  inherited  many  of  the  deficiencies  leftover  from  the  Bush/Cheney  debacle.  While  I  wish  he  would  have  accomplished  more,  and  not  strayed  as  far  from  many  of  his  campaign  promises,  Obama  has  done  a  decent  job  of  trying  to  overcome  the  adversity  of  a  republican  controlled  house/senate.  If  the  evangelical  right  would  learn  to  play  nice  there  would  be  many  more  advances  made  in  the  effort  to  have  the  U.S.  progress  vs.  reverse  its  global  course.	0
Obama  may  not  be  the  best  president  but  most  of  u  r  just  swaying  he  was  the  worst  just  because  he  is  black  well  that  is  ok  but  it  does  not  matter  if  he  is  the  best  or  worst  because  that  is  all  a  matter  of  opinion  so  please  stop  being  racist  with  the  debates	0
NO!  obama  is  a  good  president.  Bush  is  the  worst  president  america  ever  had.	0
I'm  from  england  and  Americans  need  to  give  him  more  time,  he  has  had  to  sort  out  the  massive  mess  bush  left  and  also  deal  with  mad  people  calling  him  the  anti-Christ.  he  has  managed  also  to  do  what  bush  never  managed  to  do  in  taking  down  osama  bin  laden  a  man  who  killed  over  3000  innocent  Americans.  your  country  has  got  better  since  he  came  in  and  he  deserves  some  credit,  calling  him  the  worst  president  in  American  history  is  the  most  stupidest  thing  i  have  ever  heard  most  of  the  people  going  against  him  are  only  going  against  him  because  he  is  black,  no  other  reason.	0
No  way,  people  always  say  that  about  their  current  leader.  After  a  while,  they  all  seem  to  forget  all  the  terrible  leaders  they've  had  in  the  past.	0
It  was  said  not  just  one  president  would  be  able  to  fix  what  bush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  fucked  up  bush  is  the  worst  president  ever  that  is  why  are  economy  is  so  messed  up  and  most  are  not  smart  enough  to  relize  that	0
He's  not  the  worst  president  in  US  history.  Jimmy  Carter  probably  takes  the  wrap  on  that  one.    Obama  and  Bush  have  expanded  the  powers  of  Federal  government  the  most  since  FDR.  The  national  debt  has  increased  more  under  Obama  than  any  other  president,  and  if  the  Supreme  Court  doesn't  rule  Obamacare  unconstitutional,  the  national  debt  will  exceed  anything  anyone  could  have  dreamed  of  in  the  90s.    So  I'm  very  much  against  the  Obama  administration,  but  I  wouldn't  consider  him  technically  the  WORST.	1
Obama  is  a  bad  president,  but  he  is  not  the  worst.  Sure,  he  has  started  an  illegal  drone  war  in  the  Middle  East,  signed  the  PATRIOT  ACT,  and  was  prepared  to  pass  censorship  bills  (SOPA/PIPA),  but  there  have  been  worse  presidents.  Bush  started  two  illegal  wars  that  put  our  troops  in  danger,  passed  the  PATRIOT  ACT  through  Congress,  and  his  presidency  was  disturbingly  similar  to  Hitler's  before  Hitler  became  the  Führer  of  Germany.	0
I  prefer  Obama  over  Romney,  but  only  because  Romney  is  utterly  corrupt  and  insane.    Obama  has  not  done  that  much  harm.  Obamacare  hasn't  been  tested  yet,  but  if  it  works  well  to  save  people  money,  then  I'll  be  happy.    If  it's  a  massive,  useless  drain,  then  ehh.  USA  was  going  down  the  shitter  anyways.    I  wish  he'd  fund  science  a  bit  more  though.  Not  just  NASA,  but  make  a  lot  more  grants  for  research.	0
There  are  two  that  come  instantly  to  mind  who  were  worse.  Honestly,  I  don't  know  how  W.  got  out  of  high  school,  let  alone  President?  All  politics  aside...  W  was  not  a  bright  man.  And  being  stupid  doesn't  make  you  honest  or  plain-spoken.  It  just  makes  you  stupid.  Then,  there  was  Tricky  Dick  Nixon,  far  and  away  the  most  psychopathic  president  that  we  had.	0
I  have  really  only  heard  one  semi-effective  argument  against  Obama.    Mostly,  what  I  hear  is  that  he's  Muslim,  Kenyan,  or  Black.  Frankly,  if  he  had  blond  hair  and  blue  eyes,  the  outcome  would  look  a  lot  different.  When  I'm  surrounded  by  just  white  people  and  they  feel  a  little  more  relaxed  to  use  the  N-word,  that's  mostly  what  I  hear.	0
No  obama  is  not  the  worst  nor  the  best  but  he  is  a  good  president  and  a  honest  president  too.  He  just  came  to  presidency  with  a  stack  of  debt  and  problem.  The  way  he  had  handle  things  in  U.S  is  incredible  and  i  believe  if  he  is  elected  once  more  he  will  be  able  to  bring  back  the  economy	0

While  it  is  true  that  the  debt  has  increased  under  Obama  more  than  anyone  else,  trillions  of  that  comes  from  Bush's  spending  in  Iraq/Afghanistan,  the  payments  were  delayed  so  it  wouldn't  be  Bush's  problem.    Link      If  you  look  at  what  the  two  actually  spent,  you'll  notice  a  massive  difference,  and  yet  people  still  give  Obama  responsibility  for  things  that  he  had  no  control  over.

I  do  not  see  this  as  fair  in  any  way.[SEP]I  should  have  been  more  specific  .    The  point  is  that  under  3  years  he  has    created  new  spending,  and  he  will  continue  to  increase  the  debt  with  little  mind  to  how  this  is  a  problem      The  first  article  is  not  false  (even  though  your  link  claims  it  is)  and  the  second  article  explains  why.      If  you're  looking  for  someone  who  will  actually  cut  spending  and  the  debt,  look  to  Gary  Johnson,  the  Libertarian  candidate.    Otherwise,  Romney  is  a  slightly  less  big  government  hungry  version  of  Obama.	1
He's  doing  fine.  Alot  better  than  the  last  one  we  had.      The  minimum  length  for  an  argument  is  50  characters.  The  purpose  of  this  restriction  is  to  cut  down  on  the  amount  of  dumb  jokes,  so  we  can  keep  the  quality  of  debate  and  discourse  as  high  as  possible.	0
President  Obama,  sense  the  time  of  his  election  has  fallen  drastically  in  my  opinion...  he  has  shown  himself  to  be  arrogant,  far  from  anything  close  to  By  Partisan  (with  the  exception  of  pushing  for  the  bush  tax  cuts...  which  is  commendable)  ,  his  foreign  and  domestic  policy's  have  been  either  against  the  will  of  the  people  or  for  big  controlling  (intrusive)  government...  and  now  he's  looking  to  give  amnesty  to  illegal  immigrants...  i.e.  rewarding  criminals  (dream  act)!!!???...  so  for  the  aforesaid  reasons,  and  others  that  have  not  been  stated,  Barack  Hussein  Obama  is  close  to  worst  president  in  my  book.	1

He  really  does  not  know  what  he  is  doing.  That  is  obvious.  So  why  did  people  elect  him?  Because  he  is  black.      http://www.youtube.com/  watch?v=rgfA2b9YSag	1
If  anyone  can  give  me  a  good  example  of  JUST  ONE  thing  Obama  has  done  to  help  our  country,  I'll  give  that  person  a  prize!    Oh,  wait!  HE  HASN'T  DONE  ANYTHING!!	1
He's  just  another  puppet  politician  serving  the  Powers  That  Be.  The  U.S.  will  never  have  a    good    president,  the  Powers  That  Be  will  never  allow  it  because  he/she  would  be  a  threat  to  their  power.	1
As  far  as  an  Independent  view  goes,  he's  good.  He's  not  the  absolute  best  president  we've  ever  had  but  he's  certainly  not  the  worst.	0
He's  cool.  I  don't  care  about  his  political  views.  He  seems  like  a  really  good  person.  Hell,  I  wish  I  could  sit  down  and  have  dinner  with  him,  George  Bush,  and  Bill  Clinton.	0

he  sucks.  hes  messed  up  our  country  really  bad  182956	1
It  is  lucky  that  Obama  does  things  slowly,  and  that  he  has  done  little.    It  is  lucky  that  he  is  a  mindless  puppet.  In  a  democracy,  I  do  not  want  a  ruler  who  rules  with  an  iron  fist,  I  want  a  man  who  listens  to  the  people,  and  makes  wise  decisions  that  allow  the  USA  to  continue  to  be  a  place  of  freedom  for  all.    A  man  who  wants  to  do  lots  of  things  with  a  country  will  not  be  a  good  ruler.  I  do  not  like  high  taxes,  but  I  do  like  taxes.  I  like  being  able  to  have  roads  that  are  paid  for  by  the  state,  without  tolls.      When  I  vote  in  the  next  election,  I  will  vote  for  Obama,  not  because  he  is  the  greatest  president,  but  because  he  is  the  most  sane,  of  the  two  choices  we  are  given.  Romney  does  not  appear  to  be  fully  sane,  nor  does  he  seem  to  have  an  ounce  of  altruism  within  him.  I  think  he  will  ruin  America  in  a  very  bad  way.  Obama  will  allow  America  to  stabilize  and  maintain  it's  velocity  in  a  steady  direction,  heading  towards  progress  and  peace.	0
Obama  is  doing  everything  SOOOOOO  slow.  He  promised  all  this  stuff  and  he  only  did  1/3...  And  since  the  all  mighty  Republicans  have  taken  over  the  house,  no  major  bills  will  be  signed.  The  will  not  fulfill  his  promises  and  therefore  he  will  not  get  re-elected...  He  is  getting  close  to  being  as  bad  as  Busch...	1

my  vote  goes  to  yes.      But  i  do  think  the  President  is  in  a  pivotal  time  in  his  presidency,  where  he  will  be  looked  back  in  a  Clinton  esque  view  or  as  generally  un  productive  President.

Obama  is  not  a  good  president.  I  would  ask  anyone  who  supports  him  to  name  something  that  he  has  done  that  will  do  anything  to  help  the  United  States.  Our  country  is  in  worse  shape  that  when  he  was  elected  and  the  fact  that  he  is  backing  down  on  virtually  all  of  his  promises  and  policies  should  tell  you  something  isn't  working.  We  don't  need  progress.  We  need  principles.	1

Lily  Ledbetter,  START  treaty,  the  repeal  of  DADT,  Consumer  Protection  legislation,  he  increased  the  Veterans  Administration  budget  to  hire  and  train  health  professionals  for  military  personnel,  funded  the  violence  against  women  act,  the  land  and  water  conservation  fund,  the  CDBG,  to  name  a  few.

First,  what  do  you  mean  by  worse  shape?  And  of  the  criteria,  that  you  use  to  establish  this  "worse  shape",  how  much  of  it  can  Obama  be  legitimately  blamed  for?    Second,  Obama  has  kept  just  under  130  (an  additional  40  kept  with  compromise)  (and  just  under  230  in  the  works)  of  his  ~500  recorded  campaign  promises  in  the  first  two  full  years  of  his  Presidency.  That's  not  such  a  horrible  pace  that  we  should  all  abhor  his  legislative  and  other  Presidential  activities.  But  what  promises  did  he  break  and  what  policies  has  he  backed  down  from  that  you  would  have  really  liked  to  see  him  keep?      We  don't  need  progress.  We  need  principles.      A  completely  nebulous  and  possibly  useless  slogan.	0

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.

I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]lmao,    I  suppose  you  would  like  me  to  pick  up  some  of  the  conspiracy  theory  novels  you  get  your  information  from.  Because  that  type  of  research  would  be  soooo  much  more  accurate  than  cnn  and  the  internet  ._.[SEP]Your  infatuation  with  Obama  is  either  blinding  you  completely  or  you  are  purposely  distorting  facts.      Tea  Party  weirdos      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.[SEP]I'm  not  infatuated  at  all,  in  fact  I  think  he  has  been  too  moderate.  But  I'm  not  a  retard  who  lives  in  an  alternate  universe  where  Obama  has  horns.  He's  doing  a  really  good  job  especially  considering  what  he  was  left  with.      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      And  exactly  what  part  of  the  constitution  has  Obama  not  followed?  That  is  why  they  are  weird,  they  live  under  a  number  of  delusions,  that  the  government  has  been  acting  unconstitutionally  only  one  of  many.  Here  are  some  of  the  other  tea  party  delusions:    1.  Obama  was  not  born  here    2.  Obama  is  taking  your  guns  when  in  fact  he's  relaxed  gun  laws.    3.  Obama  has  raised  their  taxes,  when  in  fact  everyone  paid  less  taxes  last  year.    4.  Only  poor  black  people  who  want  free  stuff  voted  for  him  even  though  he  won  by  one  of  the  largest  majorities  in  history    I'm  sure  there  are  more  but  I  try  not  to  talk  to  the  village  idiots.    Anyway,  yes,  on  average  every  one  really  did  pay  less  taxes.  I  realize  that  ruins  many  of  those  potato  chip  stuffed  asses  reason  for  leaving  their  recliner  and  making  a  colorful  sign,  but  it  is  the  truth.    Further,  half  the  idiot  tea  party  crying  about  "Gov'ment  tooks  my  money!  WAH!"  Actually  benefit  from  one  government  program  or  another,  and  would  be  crying  even  harder  if  the  government  took  away  their  Medicare  or  social  security.    2.  No,  spending  really  has  been  cut.  The  stimulus  was  passed  under  Bush,  and  under  Obama  most  of  the  money  has  been  repaid.  It's  yet  another  silly  tea  bagger  delusion,  this  idea  that  only  Obama  passed  the  stimulus,  and  that  the  stimulus  isn't  the  only  thing  that  saved  us  from  another  great  depression.  Every  expert  says  without  it  we  would  be  living  in  Hoover  tents  right  now.  Anyway,      part  of  the  problem  I  see,  is  that  people  like  yourself  when  I  say  "spending  has  been  cut"  you  are  comparing  spending  now,  to  spending  in  magical  fairy  land,  while  I  on  the  other  hand  am  dealing  with  reality,  and  the  spending  during  the  Bush  years.    3.  Uh,  no.    Every    country  that  has  a  similar  plan,  and  usually  an  even  more  liberal  plan  than  what  was  passed  here,  spends  less  per  capita  on  healthcare.  That  means  they  have  more  money.  That  means  they  are  less  likely  to  have  financial  meltdowns  due  to  healthcare.  Again,  you  do  not  argue  in  reality.  Look  at  any  chart  of  healthcare  spending  and  you  will  see  the  US  spent  nearly  twice  as  much  as  any  country  before  this  was  passed.    4.  Oh  my  god,  are  you  literally  retarded?  I  mean  I  had  my  suspicions  when  I  saw  your  name,  looks  like  a  gay  dating  site  title,  but  that  aside  I  didn't  really  think  you  were  literally  retarded  until  I  saw  your  number  4  point  there.      Bush  was  handed  the  best  economy  in  the  history  of  the  US  due  to  Clinton's  policies.  This  massive  surplus  was  literally  squandered  by  that  monkey  Bush  in  about  3  years.  Due  to  what  you  call  "stimulus"  which  is  really  just  tax  cuts  for  people  who  don't  need  them  and  won't  put  the  money  back  into  the  economy  and  insane  deregulation  that  started  with  Reagan,  we  went  from  the  greatest  US  economy  in  history  to  the  second  worst  in  US  history.    It  is  truly  an  accomplishment  in  itself,  how  one  crappy  president  with  daddy  issues  can  bring  an  entire  economy  to  it's  knees  so  quickly.  Now  we  have  an  intelligent  person  in  office,  and  for  the  first  time  in  about  6  years  each  month  is  showing  less  job  losses  than  the  last,  and  in  some  instances  actual  job  gains,    and  still  you  preach  Bush  era  economic  strategy.  It  is  truly  mind  boggling  how  one  can  be  so  completely  clueless.    Honestly  I'm  bored  of  you  now.    I  will  add  though  to  your  "bigot"  comment.  You  do  realize  that  if  Obama  were  not  black  this  fake  corporate  run  grass  roots  tea  bagger  bs  would  not  happen.  Sure  some  are  just  clueless  idiots  who  live  in  a  Faux  Noise  media  alternate  Universe  and  have  no  idea  how  backwards  their  view  of  what  is  going  on  is,  but  most  are  pissed  because  "real  America"  as  they  put  it,  in  there  view  does  not  include  black  people.  Disliking  people  because  of  their  opinions  is  far  different  than  comparing  a  democratically  elected  president  to  Hitler  and  insisting  he  was  not  born  here  all  because  of  the  color  of  his  skin.    And  I  don't  want  to  hear  the  old  line  "no  that's  not  it  uh,  uh,  it's  his  policies."    Bullshit.  Where  was  the  tea  party  in  the  Clinton  years?  Where  was  the  tea  party  when  Bush  with  the  help  of  that  troll  Cheyenne  destroyed  the  strongest  economy  in  the  world?  Nowhere,  because  Clinton  and  Bush  are  white.  Bigot  indeed.[SEP]I'm  sorry,  your  facts  are  almost  all  completely  made  up,  and  it  is  you,  sir  who  are  living  in  a  land  of  delusions.  I  would  respond  to  you  point  by  point,  but  I  attempted  that  and  it's  clearly  not  worth  the  effort.  Every  word  you  say  is  just  reiterated  talking  points  from  the  democratic  party.  I  don't  think  Bush  was  all  that,  he  did  some  terrible  things.  I  think  the  republicans  do  some  terrible  things.  I  can't  believe  how  blindly  you  are  following  not  just  one  party,  but  one  man.  Turn  off  the  internet,  turn  off  cnn,  start  doing  some  real  research  and  open  your  mind,  you'll  find  that  both  political  parties  and  all  politicians  are  corrupt.	0

Obama  sucks  a      cause  he  is  killing  the  people  that  dont  have  a  second  income  form  husband/wife  and  that  person  makes  enough  to  get  their  taxes  raised  i  had  to  sell  my  house  because  of  this  new  piece  of  shit  so  called  presdent	1
You  know  what  f    k  you!  He  didn't  even  do  anything  wrong!  In  fact,  he  has  done  alot  of  things:  the  health  care  bill,  he's  reformed  taxes,  and  he  has  built  a  foundacion  to  work  on.	0

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]"That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%."    Unemployment  counts  only  people  that  are  seeking  employment,  so  in  reality  your  argument  holds  no  real  merit  because  either  more  people  are  losing  jobs  or  more  people  that  had  stopped  looking  for  jobs,  started  looking  again  after  the  stimulus,  therefore  making  them  counted  as  unemployed.  Really  there's  no  way  2  be  sure  either  way.[SEP]Your  infatuation  with  Obama  is  either  blinding  you  completely  or  you  are  purposely  distorting  facts.      Tea  Party  weirdos      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.	0
Obama  was  a  no  body  and  was  a  set  up  for  Minority  rally  and  votes  ..for  the  purpose  to  further  the  Liberal  agenda's  ,  which  in  my  opinion  has  been  some  of  the  most  destructive  items  brought  forth  in  recent  times....  they  need  to  get  remember  The  People  and  not  them  selves..	1
All  he  done  so  far:  convinced  all  our  friends  and  enemies  that  we  the  USA  are  responsible  for  all  of  the  world's  problems,  that  we  are  a  muslim  nation,  spent  and  committed  so  much  of  the  taxpayer's  moneys  that  we  cannot  evr  get  out  of  this  mess,  and  he  still  continues  printing  more  green  bucks,  without  any  real  backing,  has  convinced  business  people  that  he  is  very  hostile  towards  business.  There's  plenty  more  but  if  you  love  his  white  teeth  when  e  smiles  at  you,  there  is  little  hope  for  you,  and  this  once  great  country  of  ours.	1
He  can  suck  my  left  nut!  Yea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    jk  he  is  okay  but  he  is  in  way  over  his  head	1
i  like  the  fact  that  he  is  making  the  effort  but  he  is  fucking  up  big  time.      the  bailouts  sucked  but  if  it  did  not  happen  the  economy  would  be  fucked  so  that  was  good.      Iraq/  Afghan  war?????????  what  the  fuck...........get  them  out  now.  didn't  he  say  they  would  be  out  by  2012...  that  is  not  happening  from  what  it  looks  like.  he  fucking  sent  more  troops.    Guantanamo  or  how  ever  you  spell  it?????  you  said  you  would  close  it  and  yet  to  happen.  why  do  we  want  to  close  it  anyway  ???      If  you  think  obama  is  doing  a  good  job  just  wait  till  the  unemployment  checks  stop  coming.  15plus  million  Americans  are  on  it  and  some  have  been  on  it  for  2  years.  the  gov  cannot  keep  paying  people  forever.  he  spent  time  on  health  care  and  so  on  and  not  making  jobs!!!!!!!!  so  when  the  checks  stop  coming  and  the  day  is  sooner  than  you  think!!!  millions  of  people  will  be  calling  for  his  head.    health  care....i  do  believe  that  the  laws  and  insurance  companies  were  fucking  people  but  when  the  economy  is  fucked,  we  have  2  wars,  a  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  immigration  reform  and  so  on  you  fucking  choose  to  spend  6  months  debating  on  health  care  and  when  51  %  of  Americans  say  they  don't  want  it  you  do  it  anyway????  wow  fucking  great  move      Henry  lewis  Gates/  cop  argument.....  he  came  out  the  next  day  literally  calling  the  cop  stupid...but  all  this  before  he  even  heard  all  the  details.  obama  sided  with  gates  even  tho  hes  a  5'4  pompous  little  bitch.    same  with  immigration  reform......he  said  it  can  lead  to  racial  profiling/  is  unconstitutional  all  before  reading  he  law.....never  mind  that  70  of  AZ  citizens  approve  the  law  and  the  wall  street  journal/  pue  institute  a  very  respectable  intuition  polled  and  found  out  more  that  60  of  Americans  favor  the  AZ  law.	1

I  have  no  respect  for  the  guy  who  worships  with  Terrorist-Americans  through  there  same  relegious  beliefs!!  Obama  has  the  same  relegious  beleifs  as  Osama  Bin  Loden  for  crying  out  loud!!??  I  am  150%  Anti-Obama  and  will  be  until  the  end  of  times!!	1
People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]"That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%."    Unemployment  counts  only  people  that  are  seeking  employment,  so  in  reality  your  argument  holds  no  real  merit  because  either  more  people  are  losing  jobs  or  more  people  that  had  stopped  looking  for  jobs,  started  looking  again  after  the  stimulus,  therefore  making  them  counted  as  unemployed.  Really  there's  no  way  2  be  sure  either  way.[SEP]Actually  I've  finished  16  "grades  of  school"  -  A  average    Ad  hominem  attacks  aside,  that  chart  I  have  linked  is  from  the  same  source  used  during  the  Bush  administration.  This  tricky  math  you  are  accusing  the  link  of  using  is  simply  not  true.  There  were  200,000    net    jobs  created.  The  chart  shows    net    loss/gain.    That  more  of  the  unemployed  begin  again  to  look  for  work,  and  so  are  again  counted  in  the  percentage  of  unemployed  -  keeping  the  numbers  aproximately  the  same,  in  no  way  negates  that  jobs  were  created  -  it  just  means  we  have  a  messed  up  way  of  counting  unemployment  rates.  You  can  thank  Regan  for  that  by  the  way,  one  of  the  many  tricks  his  corporate  overlords  used  to  pad  Regan's  scores  while  he  acted  like  a  President.    And  the  point  is  not  that  jobs  had  been  created  every  month,  I  just  mentioned  that  new  numbers  were  in  for  January.  The  point  is  in  spite  of  Republican  economic  policies  bringing  the  strongest  economy  in  the  history  of  the  world  practically  to  its  knees  in  8  short  years,  Obama  in  2  short  years  has  managed  to  at  least  slow  the  bleeding.[SEP]Your  infatuation  with  Obama  is  either  blinding  you  completely  or  you  are  purposely  distorting  facts.      Tea  Party  weirdos      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.	0

Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.

I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]Spending  has  actually  been  cut        Your  a  moron  haven't  you  heard  of  his  trip  to  India?

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]I  have  one  question  for  people  who  support  obama:  Do  you  like  freedom?  Obama  is  a  fucking  socialist  and  his  stimulus  failed  he  is  campaigning  while  republicans  are  working.  One  guy  said  we  gained  200,000  jobs  in  january.  If  i  recall  correctly  january  is  1/12  of  a  year  and  it  is  just  reducing  the  number  of  jobs  that  obama  has  killed.  I  wish  in  my  english  class  i  could  write  a  persuasive  essay  about  democrats  in  general  being  stupid  and  ruining  the  ideals  of  this  country  including  capitalism.	1
I'm  British/American,  currently  living  in  wales,  but  I'm  pro  obama  since  he  hasn't  royally  screwed  up  like  bush.  and  it  was  either  him  or  McCain,  and  with  Sarah  as  Macons  vice,  if  something  ever  happened  to  McCain  and  Sarah  became  president...I'm  sorry  but  i  wouldn't  be  willing  to  take  the  risk.	0
he  s  very  practical  and  efficient.he  is  able  to  even  lead  the  world..america  is  still  standing  strait  in  the  economic  reccesion  is  only  because  fo  him....	0
The  claim  that  he  is  turning  this  country  into  a  socialist  nation  is  ridiculous.  We  have  seen  what  happens  when  there  is  barely  any  regulation  at  all,  so  obviously  the  government  has  to  take  some  control.  Who  do  you  trust  more  with  your  money,  insurance  etc.-  the  government,  whose  only  interest  is  the  welfare  of  the  American  people,  or  someone  whose  only  interest  is  profit?  Just  another  ploy  by  the  desperate  right  wing  to  taint  America's  view  of  a  wise  and  highly  competent  leader  for  their  own  political  profit.	0
People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.      Because  everyone  who  disagrees  with  you  must  not  be  involved  in  reality...    As  for  your  list  of  "accomplishments"  it  was  rather  clever  of  you  to  use  a  link  to  another  forums  and  by  doing  so  hiding  the  fact  that  the  list  is  from  DailyKos.    I  wish  I  could  color  code  stuff,  but  bold  will  represent  things  that  are  nothing  special  or  would  have  most  likely  been  done  by  McCain  and  italics  will  represent  something  that  should  not  be  the  government's  job  or  something  that  is  not  even  an  accomplishment.      1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?      Cutting  taxes  is  something  that  just  about  any  leader  would  do  in  a  recession,  its  the  future  tax  hikes  to  cancel  out  the  huge  deficits  that  people  are  pissed  about.      2.    Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually  shrinking  the  size  of  government.      $82.69  billion  dollar  deficits  this  April,  though  it  is  nice  to  see  the  military  industrial  complex  get  a  kick  in  the  balls.      3.    Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.

I'm  sure  the  free-riders  in  this  country  will  love  it  and  those  who  realize  that  we  have  no  way  to  pay  for  it  will  hate.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Keynesian  economics:  Fix  something  in  the  short  run  only  to  see  it  fail  even  more  in  the  long  run.      5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    I  oppose  the  war,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  recent  success.      And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending      Trying  to  make  agencies  more  efficient  is  not  a  new  concept.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      See  above.    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    I'll  give  him  credit...  though  if  women  are  to  except  maternity  leave  then  they  ought  to  expect  lesser  pay.      1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    Good.      1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB      McCain  would  have  likely  done  something  similar.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;  reporting  full  information      Seeing  as  every  tv  station  not  named  Fox  is  in  the  tank  for  him  this  is  not  much  of  accomplishment.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  covering  the  return  of  fallen  soldiers  to  Dover  AFB;  the  media  is  now  permitted  to  do  so  pending  adherence  to  respectful  rules  and  approval  of  fallen  soldier's  family    Good.      1.The  White  House  and  federal  government  are  respecting  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act      Until  what  goes  on  behind  closed  doors  with  the  Federal  Reserve  and  Obama's  negotiations  with  Unions  and  Democrats  this  is  not  much  of  an  accomplishment.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      Really?  They  are  counting  this  as  an  accomplishment?    1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House    I  like  this  one.    1.Limits  on  White  House  aides  working  for  lobbyists  after  their  tenure  in  the  administration    There  are  still  loop  holes  but  if  this  policy  works  I'll  give  him  credit.      1.Ended  the  previous  stop-loss  policy  that  kept  soldiers  in  Iraq/Afghanistan  longer  than  their  enlistment  date      McCain  might  have  done  something  like  this,  but  I'll  give  Obama  credit.    1.Phasing  out  the  expensive  F-22  war  plane  and  other  outdated  weapons  systems,  which  weren't  even  used  or  needed  in  Iraq/Afghanistan    1.Removed  restrictions  on  embryonic  stem-cell  research      1.Federal  support  for  stem-cell  and  new  biomedical  research      I  don't  mind  stem-cell  research,  but  tax  payers  should  not  pay  for  it.        1.New  federal  funding  for  science  and  research  labs      Not  their  job  to  do  so.    1.States  are  permitted  to  enact  federal  fuel  efficiency  standards  above  federal  standards    I  would  respect  this  if  he  had  a  consistent  record  as  to  what  the  states  are  allowed  to.    1.Increased  infrastructure  spending  (roads,  bridges,  power  plants)  after  years  of  neglect      1.Funds  for  high-speed,  broadband  Internet  access  to  K-12  schools      Not  government's  job.      1.New  funds  for  school  construction      Not  government's  job,  the  schools  still  suck  anyways.        1.The  prison  at  Guantanamo  Bay  is  being  phased  out      This  one  is  just  fucking  retarded  and  is  nothing  more  then  a  PR  move.  If  he  wants  to  change  the  prison's  policies  then  that  is  one  thing,  but  closing  down  a  prison  only  to  send  the  prisoners  elsewhere  is  just  stupid.        1.US  Auto  industry  rescue  plan      Propping  up  failing  companies  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Housing  rescue  plan      He  still  needs  to  fix  Fannie  and  Freddie.      1.$789  billion  economic  stimulus  plan      The  tax  cut  parts  were  good,  the  rest  not  so  much.      1.The  public  can  meet  with  federal  housing  insurers  to  refinance  (the  new  plan  can  be  completed  in  one  day)  a  mortgage  if  they  are  having  trouble  paying      1.US  financial  and  banking  rescue  plan      Not  government's  job.    1.The  secret  detention  facilities  in  Eastern  Europe  and  elsewhere  are  being  closed    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  policy;

 stimulated  auto  sales      Not  the  government's  job,  no  way  to  pay  for  the  program,  Japan  automakers  love  us  now.    1.Announced  plans  to  purchase  fuel  efficient  American-made  fleet  for  the  federal  government      1.Expanded  the  SCHIP  program  to  cover  health  care  for  4  million  more  children      Not  government's  job.      1.Signed  national  service  legislation;  expanded  national  youth  service  program      Not  government's  job.      1.Instituted  a  new  policy  on  Cuba,  allowing  Cuban  families  to  return  home  to  visit  loved  ones      He  could  just  lift  the  ban  on  Cuba  altogether  seeing  as  it  hurts  the  Cuban  people  more  then  it  hurts  their  government.        1.Ended  the  previous  policy  of  not  regulating  and  labeling  carbon  dioxide  emissions      Not  government's  job.      1.Expanding  vaccination  programs      And  wasting  millions  in  the  process  on  unused  vaccines.        1.Immediate  and  efficient  response  to  the  floods  in  North  Dakota  and  other  natural  disasters      MSNBC  was  criticizing  the  government  for  not  doing  anything,  enforcing  something  like  this  after  you  are  chewed  out  is  not  an  accomplishment.      1.Closed  offshore  tax  safe  havens    Good.    1.Negotiated  deal  with  Swiss  banks  to  permit  US  government  to  gain  access  to  records  of  tax  evaders  and  criminals    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  policy  of  offering  tax  benefits  to  corporations  who  outsource  American  jobs;  the  new  policy  is  to  promote  in-sourcing  to  bring  jobs  back    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  practice  of  protecting  credit  card  companies;  in  place  of  it  are  new  consumer  protections  from  credit  card  industry's  predatory  practices    Good.      1.Energy  producing  plants  must  begin  preparing  to  produce  15%  of  their  energy  from  renewable  sources      Not  government's  job.      1.Lower  drug  costs  for  seniors      Not  government's  job.    1.Ended  the  previous  practice  of  forbidding  Medicare  from  negotiating  with  drug  manufacturers  for  cheaper  drugs;

 reengaging  in  multilateral  and  bilateral  talks  and  diplomacy    Good      1.Established  a  new  cyber  security  office      And  now  he  wants  the  government  to  be  able  to  take  control  of  the  internet  in  case  of  "emergency".      1.Beginning  the  process  of  reforming  and  restructuring  the  military  20  years  after  the  Cold  War  to  a  more  modern  fighting  force;  this  includes  new  procurement  policies,  increasing  size  of  military,  new  technology  and  cyber  units  and  operations,  etc.      New  president,  new  policy.      1.Ended  previous  policy  of  awarding  no-bid  defense  contracts    Good      1.Ordered  a  review  of  hurricane  and  natural  disaster  preparedness      Sounds  like  something  any  president  would  do.      1.Established  a  National  Performance  Officer  charged  with  saving  the  federal  government  money  and  making  federal  operations  more  efficient        1.Students  struggling  to  make  college  loan  payments  can  have  their  loans  refinanced      Not  government's  job,  if  they  really  gave  a  shit  then  they  would  have  fixed  the  problem  of  the  rising  costs  of  college,  but  seeing  as  the  left  is  in  love  with  academia  I  doubt  that  will  happen.      1.Improving  benefits  for  veterans      McCain.      1.Many  more  press  conferences  and  town  halls  and  much  more  media  access  than  previous  administration      Narcissism  is  not  an  accomplishment.      1.Instituted  a  new  focus  on  mortgage  fraud    Good.      1.The  FDA  is  now  regulating  tobacco      Increasing  the  role  of  the  nanny  state  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Ended  previous  policy  of  cutting  the  FDA  and  circumventing  FDA  rules      Increasing  the  role  of  the  nanny  state  is  not  an  accomplishment.    1.Ended  previous  practice  of  having  White  House  aides  rewrite  scientific  and  environmental  rules,  regulations,  and  reports    Good.      1.Authorized  discussions  with  North  Korea  and  private  mission  by  Pres.

Anyways,  he  appointed  some  bitch  that  he  knew  would  agree  with  him  on  most  issues,  that  is  not  an  accomplishment  that  is  politicizing  the  court,  though  that  is  nothing  new.      1.Authorized  construction/opening  of  additional  health  centers  to  care  for  veterans      McCain.      1.Limited  salaries  of  senior  White  House  aides;  cut  to  $100,000      They  should  be  making  a  lot  less.      1.Renewed  loan  guarantees  for  Israel      Fuck  Israel.      1.Changed  the  failing/status  quo  military  command  in  Afghanistan      New  president,  new  policy.      1.Deployed  additional  troops  to  Afghanistan      McCain.    1.New  Afghan  War  policy  that  limits  aerial  bombing  and  prioritizes  aid,  development  of  infrastructure,  diplomacy,  and  good  government  practices  by  Afghans    New  president,  new  policy,  but  since  this  a  really  good  policy  I'll  give  him  credit.    1.Announced  the  long-term  development  of  a  national  energy  grid  with  renewable  sources  and  cleaner,  efficient  energy  production      1.Returned  money  authorized  for  refurbishment  of  White  House  offices  and      private  living  quarters      PR  move.      1.Paid  for  redecoration  of  White  House  living  quarters  out  of  his  own  pocket      Really?  Kos  included  this  with  accomplishments.        1.Held  first  Seder  in  White  House      He  threw  a  Jewish  party?  That's  an  accomplishment?    1.Attempting  to  reform  the  nation's  healthcare  system  which  is  the  most  expensive  in  the  world  yet  leaves  almost  50  million  without  health  insurance  and  millions  more  under  insured    Already  listed.      1.Has  put  the  ball  in  play  for  comprehensive  immigration  reform      States  are  passing  their  own  laws  because  they  are  tired  of  inaction  at  federal  level.      1.Has  announced  his  intention  to  push  for  energy  reform      I  wasn't  aware  that  simply  announcing  a  plan  was  an  accomplishment.  And  since  this  is  the  Kos  what  they  mean  by  "reform"  is  cap  and  trade  that  will  cause  electricity  costs  to  sky  rocket  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  large  companies  to  continue  to  pollute  as  long  as  they  are  willing  to  buy  credits.      1.Has  announced  his  intention  to  push  for  education  reform      I  wasn't  aware  that  simply  announcing  a  plan  was  an  accomplishment.	1
I'm  not  really  sure  why  those  on  the  right  don't  love  the  man,  his  arrogance  and  condescending  attitude  will  lead  to  the  Republicans  having  huge  gains  in  November...  and  the  funny  thing  is  that  Obama  is  really  not  much  different  then  the  Republicans  that  hate  him.  Sure,  he  got  his  health  care  bill  passed,  but  other  then  that  what  has  he  done  that  was  so  different  then  Bush?      War  in  the  Middle  East?    He  is  pulling  the  troops  out  of  Iraq,  but  only  to  have  increased  activity  in  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan,  and  soon  to  be  Iran.      Patriot  Act?    Check,  still  there  and  growing  strong.      Turning  his  back  to  those  accused  of  being  terrorists?"    Check,  adios  to  Miranda  Rights.        Jumping  through  obstacles  and  use  of  bullying  to  get  unpopular  legislation  passed?    Check.  Though  the  Republicans  have  not  exactly  been  helpful.        Allowing  Wall  Street  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.  This  one  falls  more  on  Congress,  but  seeing  as  he  has  a  huge  majority  he  does  not  have  much  of  an  excuse.      Allowing  the  Federal  Reserve  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.  He's  not  even  sorry  about  this  one.      Allowing  big  banks  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check,  this  one  may  see  some  action  though.      Allowing  giant  corporations  deemed  "too  big  to  fail"  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.        Watch  as  Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie  Mae  fail?    Check,  only  a  matter  of  time  before  they  get  a  bailout.      Bailout  failing  entities?    Check.  This  time  we  have  gone  from  bailing  out  banks  to  bailing  out  countries.        Backroom  deals  hidden  from  the  public?    Check.      Criticize  the  public  for  the  same  mistakes  that  he  commits?"    Check,  telling  people  to  be  tolerant  of  different  views  in  the  media  while  declaring  the  Tea  Party  Movement  to  be  "Teabaggers"  does  not  send  the  best  message.        Holding  a  party  while  states  are  experiencing  extreme  natural  disasters?"    Check,  but  at  least  he  was  able  to  get  some  good  stand  up  comedy  done.        Offshore  drilling?"    Check,  he  might  want  to  rethink  this  compromise  over.        Go  against  gay  marriage?"    Che...  never  mind,  he  was  never  for  it.      Have  no  sense  of  fiscal  responsibility?    I'm  not  not  sure  if  I  should  even  count  this  one  because  was  there  even  any  hope  of  this  happening?        Continue  war  on  drugs?    Check,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  some  innovation  when  it  comes  to  fighting  the  war.        Pretend  to  be  for  safe  boarders  while  at  the  same  time  doing  nothing  to  protect  them?    Check.        Promote  environmentalism  while  at  the  same  time  failing  to  get  some  real  legislation  done?    Check,  I'm  aware  that  Cap  and  Trade  is  still  technically  alive,  but  seeing  as  it  is  pretty  much  dead  and  watered  down  I  think  it  might  be  safe  to  consider  this  a  failure.            Granted,  some  of  these  points  might  be  a  bit  weak  and  I'm  well  aware  that  he  has  been  able  to  get  some  leftest  bills  passed  that  have  not  gotten  much  coverage.  But  honestly,  will  the  rest  of  his  term  really  matter?  It's  become  rather  clear  that  the  majorities  that  the  Dems  hold  in  Congress  are  going  to  be  widdled  down  if  not  flat  out  erased  come  November,  so  any  major  legislation  that  he  wants  to  get  passed  will  have  to  be  done  right  now.  He  has  Congress  busy  with  the  Wall  Street  "reform"  bill,  but  that  thing  is  getting  wattered  down  to  the  point  where  it  is  looking  more  like  a  PR  stunt  rather  than  actual  legislation.      There  is  always  the  possibility  of  Obama  becoming  more  pragmatic  with  the  Republicans  during  the  second  half  of  his  term  like  Clinton  was  in  the  90's,  but  what's  the  point?  They  have  already  shown  that  they  would  rather  see  him  fail  in  order  for  their  own  political  gain  instead  of  attempting  bipartisanship.	0

Patriot  Act    I  totally  agree  with  you.    Turning  his  back  to  those  accused  of  being  terrorists    Last  time  I  checked  that  guy  that  tried  to  bomb  Times  Square  was  read  his  Miranda  Rights,  so  that  argue  is  pointless.    Jumping  through  obstacles  and  use  of  bullying  to  get  unpopular  legislation  passed    I  totally  agree  with  you.    Allowing  Wall  Street  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want.    He  has  a  huge  majority  but  59  votes  isn't  enough  to  pass  legislation,  you  need  60  votes  to  have  a  true  "majority,"  and  true,  the  Republicans  aren't  being  very  helpful,  in  fact,  their  no  help  at  all.    Allowing  the  Federal  Reserve  to  do  whatever  they  want.    I  my  personal  opinion  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  should  all  be  shot.    Allowing  big  banks  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want.    They  also  should  be  shot.  (Again  just  my  personal  opinion.)    Allowing  giant  corporations  deemed  "too  big  to  fail"  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want.    They  should  have  let  GM  collapsed  and  that  way  the  auto  worker  union  would  have  be  broken  up  and  jerk  off  would  be  getting  paid  $40+  an  hour  for  putting  a  damn  blot  on  a  car.

I'm  not  really  sure  why  those  on  the  right  don't  love  the  man,  his  arrogance  and  condescending  attitude  will  lead  to  the  Republicans  having  huge  gains  in  November...  and  the  funny  thing  is  that  Obama  is  really  not  much  different  then  the  Republicans  that  hate  him.  Sure,  he  got  his  health  care  bill  passed,  but  other  then  that  what  has  he  done  that  was  so  different  then  Bush?      War  in  the  Middle  East?    He  is  pulling  the  troops  out  of  Iraq,  but  only  to  have  increased  activity  in  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan,  and  soon  to  be  Iran.      Patriot  Act?    Check,  still  there  and  growing  strong.      Turning  his  back  to  those  accused  of  being  terrorists?"    Check,  adios  to  Miranda  Rights.        Jumping  through  obstacles  and  use  of  bullying  to  get  unpopular  legislation  passed?    Check.  Though  the  Republicans  have  not  exactly  been  helpful.        Allowing  Wall  Street  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.  This  one  falls  more  on  Congress,  but  seeing  as  he  has  a  huge  majority  he  does  not  have  much  of  an  excuse.      Allowing  the  Federal  Reserve  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.  He's  not  even  sorry  about  this  one.      Allowing  big  banks  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check,  this  one  may  see  some  action  though.      Allowing  giant  corporations  deemed  "too  big  to  fail"  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.        Watch  as  Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie  Mae  fail?    Check,  only  a  matter  of  time  before  they  get  a  bailout.      Bailout  failing  entities?    Check.

Continue  war  on  drugs?    Check,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  some  innovation  when  it  comes  to  fighting  the  war.

Check,  I'm  aware  that  Cap  and  Trade  is  still  technically  alive,  but  seeing  as  it  is  pretty  much  dead  and  watered  down  I  think  it  might  be  safe  to  consider  this  a  failure.            Granted,  some  of  these  points  might  be  a  bit  weak  and  I'm  well  aware  that  he  has  been  able  to  get  some  leftest  bills  passed  that  have  not  gotten  much  coverage.  But  honestly,  will  the  rest  of  his  term  really  matter?  It's  become  rather  clear  that  the  majorities  that  the  Dems  hold  in  Congress  are  going  to  be  widdled  down  if  not  flat  out  erased  come  November,  so  any  major  legislation  that  he  wants  to  get  passed  will  have  to  be  done  right  now.  He  has  Congress  busy  with  the  Wall  Street  "reform"  bill,  but  that  thing  is  getting  wattered  down  to  the  point  where  it  is  looking  more  like  a  PR  stunt  rather  than  actual  legislation.      There  is  always  the  possibility  of  Obama  becoming  more  pragmatic  with  the  Republicans  during  the  second  half  of  his  term  like  Clinton  was  in  the  90's,  but  what's  the  point?  They  have  already  shown  that  they  would  rather  see  him  fail  in  order  for  their  own  political  gain  instead  of  attempting  bipartisanship.[SEP]War  in  the  Middle  East.    so  your  mad  that  he's  pulling  troops  out  a  country  that  did  not  attack  us  (9/11  hijackers  weren't  from  Iraq)  and  sending  more  troops  to  the  countries  were  al-qaeda  (you  know  the  one's  that  attacked  us)  are  based?    Patriot  Act    I  totally  agree  with  you.    Turning  his  back  to  those  accused  of  being  terrorists    Last  time  I  checked  that  guy  that  tried  to  bomb  Times  Square  was  read  his  Miranda  Rights,  so  that  argue  is  pointless.

Must  of  these  laws  that  you  want  him  to  enforce  are  bull  shit.  When  he  tries  to  make  laws  that  will  be  better,  the  Republicans  block  any  sort  of  progress.    "He  did,  that's  why  it  is  on  my  list  of  ways  Obama  =  Bush."    Let  me  restate  that  in  actuality  Bush's  response  was  worse  then  Obama's,  Bush  was  told  by  the  Govenor  of  Louisana  as  well  as  the  Mayor  of  New  Orleans  that  the  leevees  would  not  hold  prior  to  Katrina  but  did  nothing,  it  hit  New  Orleans  on  Monday  and  Bush  overflew  the  devastated  area  on  Air  Force  One  as  he  traveled  from  Texas  back  to  Washington,  D.C.  on  Wednesday  and  wasn't  briefed  about  the  situation  until  he  arrived  at  the  Gulf  Coast  on  Friday.  Thats  a  week  of  doing  nothing  even  though  he  had  already  been  told  prior  to  Katrina  that  the  leevees  would  not  hold.    The  oil  spill  that  is  occuring  right  now  however  was  not  predicted  and  Obama  was  told  by  BP  that  it  was  not  a  serious  problem  and  wasn't  told  that  the  leak  was  in  fact  serious  until  almost  a  week  later.    Bottom  Line:  Obama  didn't  know,  Bush  didn't  even  care.    "Actually,  Bush  was  the  one  who  passed  the  first  bail  outs  and  in  2003  he  tried  to  regulate  Fanny  and  Freddie  but  the  Democrats  blocked  him."    The  recession  started  around  December  of  2007  so  Bush's  bail  outs  didn't  do  shit.  As  for  the  Democrats  blocking  Bush  from  Fanny  and  Freddie,  the  Republicans  are  doing  the  same  thing  now  with  Wall  Street.	0
I'm  not  really  sure  why  those  on  the  right  don't  love  the  man,  his  arrogance  and  condescending  attitude  will  lead  to  the  Republicans  having  huge  gains  in  November...  and  the  funny  thing  is  that  Obama  is  really  not  much  different  then  the  Republicans  that  hate  him.  Sure,  he  got  his  health  care  bill  passed,  but  other  then  that  what  has  he  done  that  was  so  different  then  Bush?      War  in  the  Middle  East?    He  is  pulling  the  troops  out  of  Iraq,  but  only  to  have  increased  activity  in  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan,  and  soon  to  be  Iran.      Patriot  Act?    Check,  still  there  and  growing  strong.      Turning  his  back  to  those  accused  of  being  terrorists?"    Check,  adios  to  Miranda  Rights.        Jumping  through  obstacles  and  use  of  bullying  to  get  unpopular  legislation  passed?    Check.  Though  the  Republicans  have  not  exactly  been  helpful.        Allowing  Wall  Street  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.  This  one  falls  more  on  Congress,  but  seeing  as  he  has  a  huge  majority  he  does  not  have  much  of  an  excuse.      Allowing  the  Federal  Reserve  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.  He's  not  even  sorry  about  this  one.      Allowing  big  banks  to  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check,  this  one  may  see  some  action  though.      Allowing  giant  corporations  deemed  "too  big  to  fail"  do  whatever  the  fuck  they  want?    Check.        Watch  as  Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie  Mae  fail?    Check,  only  a  matter  of  time  before  they  get  a  bailout.      Bailout  failing  entities?    Check.  This  time  we  have  gone  from  bailing  out  banks  to  bailing  out  countries.        Backroom  deals  hidden  from  the  public?    Check.      Criticize  the  public  for  the  same  mistakes  that  he  commits?"    Check,  telling  people  to  be  tolerant  of  different  views  in  the  media  while  declaring  the  Tea  Party  Movement  to  be  "Teabaggers"  does  not  send  the  best  message.        Holding  a  party  while  states  are  experiencing  extreme  natural  disasters?"    Check,  but  at  least  he  was  able  to  get  some  good  stand  up  comedy  done.        Offshore  drilling?"    Check,  he  might  want  to  rethink  this  compromise  over.        Go  against  gay  marriage?"    Che...  never  mind,  he  was  never  for  it.      Have  no  sense  of  fiscal  responsibility?    I'm  not  not  sure  if  I  should  even  count  this  one  because  was  there  even  any  hope  of  this  happening?        Continue  war  on  drugs?    Check,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  some  innovation  when  it  comes  to  fighting  the  war.        Pretend  to  be  for  safe  boarders  while  at  the  same  time  doing  nothing  to  protect  them?    Check.        Promote  environmentalism  while  at  the  same  time  failing  to  get  some  real  legislation  done?    Check,  I'm  aware  that  Cap  and  Trade  is  still  technically  alive,  but  seeing  as  it  is  pretty  much  dead  and  watered  down  I  think  it  might  be  safe  to  consider  this  a  failure.            Granted,  some  of  these  points  might  be  a  bit  weak  and  I'm  well  aware  that  he  has  been  able  to  get  some  leftest  bills  passed  that  have  not  gotten  much  coverage.  But  honestly,  will  the  rest  of  his  term  really  matter?  It's  become  rather  clear  that  the  majorities  that  the  Dems  hold  in  Congress  are  going  to  be  widdled  down  if  not  flat  out  erased  come  November,  so  any  major  legislation  that  he  wants  to  get  passed  will  have  to  be  done  right  now.  He  has  Congress  busy  with  the  Wall  Street  "reform"  bill,  but  that  thing  is  getting  wattered  down  to  the  point  where  it  is  looking  more  like  a  PR  stunt  rather  than  actual  legislation.      There  is  always  the  possibility  of  Obama  becoming  more  pragmatic  with  the  Republicans  during  the  second  half  of  his  term  like  Clinton  was  in  the  90's,  but  what's  the  point?  They  have  already  shown  that  they  would  rather  see  him  fail  in  order  for  their  own  political  gain  instead  of  attempting  bipartisanship.[SEP]This  is  really  well  written.  The  problem  with  Obama  is  that  he's  also  a  bad  liberal.  Even  the  health  care  bill  accomplished  almost  nothing  the  democratic  party  wanted  and  mostly  played  into  the  pocketbooks  of  the  Insurance  company,  who  will  now  get  more  business  and  have  an  excuse  to  charge  what  they  want.  To  be  fair,  the  republicans  in  Congress  have  dug  in  their  heels  and  refuse  to  do  almost  anything,  but  they're  only  getting  away  with  it  because  of  Obama  and  the  dems  in  Congress  inability  to  either  work  together  and  use  their  super  majority  or  approach  the  republicans  in  a  way  to  make  things  work.    This  was  the  dems  opportunity  for  a  golden  age  of  several  years  of  dem  control.  Instead,  they  will  probably  lose  everything  in  the  next  two  elections.	1

I  think  that  people  still  aren't  over  all  of  Bush's  fuck  ups  yet  so  there  probably  won't  be  a  huge  change  to  support  for  Republicans.  They  had  that  special  election  in  Pa.  was  won  by  a  Democrat  a  couple  days  ago  so  I  think  that  this  next  election  could  really  go  either  way  for  the  Democrats.  I  think  that  everyone  is  just  tired  of  the  establishment  and  wants  to  get  rid  of  the  incumbents.  So  I  guess  since  Dems  have  a  majority,  they  are  the  bigger  target  but  the  fact  the  people  are  still  pissed  at  Bush,  balances  out  both  parties  chances  of  victory.  Atleast  thats  how  I  feel.	0
Obama  is  the  first  African-American  president,  and  also  the  youngest  president  to  be  elected  into  office,  which  is  two  records  right  there.	0

I  think  he's  pretty  cool.  I  like  his  policies,  but  I  think  he  is  trying  to  please  too  many  people  and  that  just  ends  up  making  everyone  hate  him.	0
People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.      Because  everyone  who  disagrees  with  you  must  not  be  involved  in  reality...    As  for  your  list  of  "accomplishments"  it  was  rather  clever  of  you  to  use  a  link  to  another  forums  and  by  doing  so  hiding  the  fact  that  the  list  is  from  DailyKos.    I  wish  I  could  color  code  stuff,  but  bold  will  represent  things  that  are  nothing  special  or  would  have  most  likely  been  done  by  McCain  and  italics  will  represent  something  that  should  not  be  the  government's  job  or  something  that  is  not  even  an  accomplishment.      1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?      Cutting  taxes  is  something  that  just  about  any  leader  would  do  in  a  recession,  its  the  future  tax  hikes  to  cancel  out  the  huge  deficits  that  people  are  pissed  about.      2.    Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually  shrinking  the  size  of  government.      $82.69  billion  dollar  deficits  this  April,  though  it  is  nice  to  see  the  military  industrial  complex  get  a  kick  in  the  balls.      3.    Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.      I'm  sure  the  free-riders  in  this  country  will  love  it  and  those  who  realize  that  we  have  no  way  to  pay  for  it  will  hate.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Keynesian  economics:  Fix  something  in  the  short  run  only  to  see  it  fail  even  more  in  the  long  run.      5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    I  oppose  the  war,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  recent  success.      And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending      Trying  to  make  agencies  more  efficient  is  not  a  new  concept.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      See  above.    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    I'll  give  him  credit...  though  if  women  are  to  except  maternity  leave  then  they  ought  to  expect  lesser  pay.      1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    Good.      1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB      McCain  would  have  likely  done  something  similar.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;  reporting  full  information      Seeing  as  every  tv  station  not  named  Fox  is  in  the  tank  for  him  this  is  not  much  of  accomplishment.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  covering  the  return  of  fallen  soldiers  to  Dover  AFB;  the  media  is  now  permitted  to  do  so  pending  adherence  to  respectful  rules  and  approval  of  fallen  soldier's  family    Good.      1.The  White  House  and  federal  government  are  respecting  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act      Until  what  goes  on  behind  closed  doors  with  the  Federal  Reserve  and  Obama's  negotiations  with  Unions  and  Democrats  this  is  not  much  of  an  accomplishment.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      Really?  They  are  counting  this  as  an  accomplishment?    1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House    I  like  this  one.    1.Limits  on  White  House  aides  working  for  lobbyists  after  their  tenure  in  the  administration    There  are  still  loop  holes  but  if  this  policy  works  I'll  give  him  credit.      1.Ended  the  previous  stop-loss  policy  that  kept  soldiers  in  Iraq/Afghanistan  longer  than  their  enlistment  date      McCain  might  have  done  something  like  this,  but  I'll  give  Obama  credit.    1.Phasing  out  the  expensive  F-22  war  plane  and  other  outdated  weapons  systems,  which  weren't  even  used  or  needed  in  Iraq/Afghanistan    1.Removed  restrictions  on  embryonic  stem-cell  research      1.Federal  support  for  stem-cell  and  new  biomedical  research      I  don't  mind  stem-cell  research,  but  tax  payers  should  not  pay  for  it.        1.New  federal  funding  for  science  and  research  labs      Not  their  job  to  do  so.    1.States  are  permitted  to  enact  federal  fuel  efficiency  standards  above  federal  standards    I  would  respect  this  if  he  had  a  consistent  record  as  to  what  the  states  are  allowed  to.    1.Increased  infrastructure  spending  (roads,  bridges,  power  plants)  after  years  of  neglect      1.Funds  for  high-speed,  broadband  Internet  access  to  K-12  schools      Not  government's  job.      1.New  funds  for  school  construction      Not  government's  job,  the  schools  still  suck  anyways.        1.The  prison  at  Guantanamo  Bay  is  being  phased  out      This  one  is  just  fucking  retarded  and  is  nothing  more  then  a  PR  move.  If  he  wants  to  change  the  prison's  policies  then  that  is  one  thing,  but  closing  down  a  prison  only  to  send  the  prisoners  elsewhere  is  just  stupid.        1.US  Auto  industry  rescue  plan      Propping  up  failing  companies  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Housing  rescue  plan      He  still  needs  to  fix  Fannie  and  Freddie.      1.$789  billion  economic  stimulus  plan      The  tax  cut  parts  were  good,  the  rest  not  so  much.      1.The  public  can  meet  with  federal  housing  insurers  to  refinance  (the  new  plan  can  be  completed  in  one  day)  a  mortgage  if  they  are  having  trouble  paying      1.US  financial  and  banking  rescue  plan      Not  government's  job.    1.The  secret  detention  facilities  in  Eastern  Europe  and  elsewhere  are  being  closed    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  policy;  the  US  now  has  a  no  torture  policy  and  is  in  compliance  with  the  Geneva  Convention  standards    Good      1.Better  body  armor  is  now  being  provided  to  our  troops      McCain  would  have  done  the  same.    1.The  missile  defense  program  is  being  cut  by  $1.4  billion  in  2010    Good.      1.Restarted  the  nuclear  nonproliferation  talks  and  building  back  up  the  nuclear  inspection  infrastructure/protocols      New  policy  with  new  president,  nothing  special.    1.Reengaged  in  the  treaties/agreements  to  protect  the  Antarctic    Protect  it  from  what?      1.Reengaged  in  the  agreements/talks  on  global  warming  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions      More  bull  shit  regulations  from  self  righteous  environmentalists.        1.Visited  more  countries  and  met  with  more  world  leaders  than  any  president  in  his  first  six  months  in  office      And  now  they  like  us  more...  so  what?        1.Successful  release  of  US  captain  held  by  Somali  pirates;  authorized  the  SEALS  to  do  their  job      Do  you  really  think  that  a  Republican  would  have  hesitated  to  have  the  SEALS  do  their  job?      1.US  Navy  increasing  patrols  off  Somali  coast      Do  you  really  think  that  a  Republican  would  have  hesitated  to  increased  military  presence?        1.Attractive  tax  write-offs  for  those  who  buy  hybrid  automobiles      Preferential  treatment  to  his  environmental  followers  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Cash  for  clunkers  program  offers  vouchers  to  trade  in  fuel  inefficient,  polluting  old  cars  for  new  cars;  stimulated  auto  sales      Not  the  government's  job,  no  way  to  pay  for  the  program,  Japan  automakers  love  us  now.    1.Announced  plans  to  purchase  fuel  efficient  American-made  fleet  for  the  federal  government      1.Expanded  the  SCHIP  program  to  cover  health  care  for  4  million  more  children      Not  government's  job.      1.Signed  national  service  legislation;  expanded  national  youth  service  program      Not  government's  job.      1.Instituted  a  new  policy  on  Cuba,  allowing  Cuban  families  to  return  home  to  visit  loved  ones      He  could  just  lift  the  ban  on  Cuba  altogether  seeing  as  it  hurts  the  Cuban  people  more  then  it  hurts  their  government.        1.Ended  the  previous  policy  of  not  regulating  and  labeling  carbon  dioxide  emissions      Not  government's  job.      1.Expanding  vaccination  programs      And  wasting  millions  in  the  process  on  unused  vaccines.        1.Immediate  and  efficient  response  to  the  floods  in  North  Dakota  and  other  natural  disasters      MSNBC  was  criticizing  the  government  for  not  doing  anything,  enforcing  something  like  this  after  you  are  chewed  out  is  not  an  accomplishment.      1.Closed  offshore  tax  safe  havens    Good.    1.Negotiated  deal  with  Swiss  banks  to  permit  US  government  to  gain  access  to  records  of  tax  evaders  and  criminals    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  policy  of  offering  tax  benefits  to  corporations  who  outsource  American  jobs;  the  new  policy  is  to  promote  in-sourcing  to  bring  jobs  back    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  practice  of  protecting  credit  card  companies;  in  place  of  it  are  new  consumer  protections  from  credit  card  industry's  predatory  practices    Good.      1.Energy  producing  plants  must  begin  preparing  to  produce  15%  of  their  energy  from  renewable  sources      Not  government's  job.      1.Lower  drug  costs  for  seniors      Not  government's  job.    1.Ended  the  previous  practice  of  forbidding  Medicare  from  negotiating  with  drug  manufacturers  for  cheaper  drugs;  the  federal  government  is  now  realizing  hundreds  of  millions  in  savings    Good      1.Increasing  pay  and  benefits  for  military  personnel      McCain  would  have  done  something  similar.      1.Improved  housing  for  military  personnel      McCain  would  have  done  something  similar.      1.Initiating  a  new  policy  to  promote  federal  hiring  of  military  spouses      McCain  would  have  done  something  similar.      1.Improved  conditions  at  Walter  Reed  Military  Hospital  and  other  military  hospitals      McCain  would  have  done  something  similar.      1.Increasing  student  loans      Not  government's  job,  not  only  that  but  they  have  failed  to  address  growing  tuition  costs  which  negates  the  benefits  of  increasing  loans.    1.Increasing  opportunities  in  AmeriCorps  program    Ehhh,  sure,  I  like  this  one.    1.Sent  envoys  to  Middle  East  and  other  parts  of  the  world  that  had  been  neglected  for  years;  reengaging  in  multilateral  and  bilateral  talks  and  diplomacy    Good      1.Established  a  new  cyber  security  office      And  now  he  wants  the  government  to  be  able  to  take  control  of  the  internet  in  case  of  "emergency".      1.Beginning  the  process  of  reforming  and  restructuring  the  military  20  years  after  the  Cold  War  to  a  more  modern  fighting  force;  this  includes  new  procurement  policies,  increasing  size  of  military,  new  technology  and  cyber  units  and  operations,  etc.      New  president,  new  policy.      1.Ended  previous  policy  of  awarding  no-bid  defense  contracts    Good      1.Ordered  a  review  of  hurricane  and  natural  disaster  preparedness      Sounds  like  something  any  president  would  do.      1.Established  a  National  Performance  Officer  charged  with  saving  the  federal  government  money  and  making  federal  operations  more  efficient        1.Students  struggling  to  make  college  loan  payments  can  have  their  loans  refinanced      Not  government's  job,  if  they  really  gave  a  shit  then  they  would  have  fixed  the  problem  of  the  rising  costs  of  college,  but  seeing  as  the  left  is  in  love  with  academia  I  doubt  that  will  happen.      1.Improving  benefits  for  veterans      McCain.      1.Many  more  press  conferences  and  town  halls  and  much  more  media  access  than  previous  administration      Narcissism  is  not  an  accomplishment.      1.Instituted  a  new  focus  on  mortgage  fraud    Good.      1.The  FDA  is  now  regulating  tobacco      Increasing  the  role  of  the  nanny  state  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Ended  previous  policy  of  cutting  the  FDA  and  circumventing  FDA  rules      Increasing  the  role  of  the  nanny  state  is  not  an  accomplishment.    1.Ended  previous  practice  of  having  White  House  aides  rewrite  scientific  and  environmental  rules,  regulations,  and  reports    Good.      1.Authorized  discussions  with  North  Korea  and  private  mission  by  Pres.  Bill  Clinton  to  secure  the  release  of  two  Americans  held  in  prisons      The  reporters  were  not  worth  the  costs.      1.Authorized  discussions  with  Myanmar  and  mission  by  Sen.  Jim  Web  to  secure  the  release  of  an  American  held  captive      Not  worth  the  costs.    1.Making  more  loans  available  to  small  businesses    1.Established  independent  commission  to  make  recommendations  on  slowing  the  costs  of  Medicare    Good.      1.Appointment  of  first  Latina  to  the  Supreme  Court      I  thought  race  did  not  matter  to  the  left?  Anyways,  he  appointed  some  bitch  that  he  knew  would  agree  with  him  on  most  issues,  that  is  not  an  accomplishment  that  is  politicizing  the  court,  though  that  is  nothing  new.      1.Authorized  construction/opening  of  additional  health  centers  to  care  for  veterans      McCain.      1.Limited  salaries  of  senior  White  House  aides;  cut  to  $100,000      They  should  be  making  a  lot  less.      1.Renewed  loan  guarantees  for  Israel      Fuck  Israel.      1.Changed  the  failing/status  quo  military  command  in  Afghanistan      New  president,  new  policy.      1.Deployed  additional  troops  to  Afghanistan      McCain.    1.New  Afghan  War  policy  that  limits  aerial  bombing  and  prioritizes  aid,  development  of  infrastructure,  diplomacy,  and  good  government  practices  by  Afghans    New  president,  new  policy,  but  since  this  a  really  good  policy  I'll  give  him  credit.    1.Announced  the  long-term  development  of  a  national  energy  grid  with  renewable  sources  and  cleaner,  efficient  energy  production      1.Returned  money  authorized  for  refurbishment  of  White  House  offices  and      private  living  quarters      PR  move.      1.Paid  for  redecoration  of  White  House  living  quarters  out  of  his  own  pocket      Really?  Kos  included  this  with  accomplishments.        1.Held  first  Seder  in  White  House      He  threw  a  Jewish  party?  That's  an  accomplishment?    1.Attempting  to  reform  the  nation's  healthcare  system  which  is  the  most  expensive  in  the  world  yet  leaves  almost  50  million  without  health  insurance  and  millions  more  under  insured    Already  listed.      1.Has  put  the  ball  in  play  for  comprehensive  immigration  reform      States  are  passing  their  own  laws  because  they  are  tired  of  inaction  at  federal  level.      1.Has  announced  his  intention  to  push  for  energy  reform      I  wasn't  aware  that  simply  announcing  a  plan  was  an  accomplishment.  And  since  this  is  the  Kos  what  they  mean  by  "reform"  is  cap  and  trade  that  will  cause  electricity  costs  to  sky  rocket  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  large  companies  to  continue  to  pollute  as  long  as  they  are  willing  to  buy  credits.      1.Has  announced  his  intention  to  push  for  education  reform      I  wasn't  aware  that  simply  announcing  a  plan  was  an  accomplishment.[SEP]Because  everyone  who  disagrees  with  you  must  not  be  involved  in  reality      No,  you  can  disagree.  I'm  talking  about  the  ridiculous  hatred...  as  evidenced  by  the  tag  "fuck  him"  and  basically  every  insane  tea  party.    1.  okay  so  you  hate  him  for  taxes  he  hasn't  raised...  that  makes  sense  ._.    2.  the  f-22  program  wasn't  a  kick  in  the  balls  at  all.  It  was  a  billion  dollar  program  for  planes  the  military  does  not  use  only  kept  alive  because  senators  in  respective  states  that  made  the  planes  have  been  too  week  to  support  cutting  the  program.  And  that  the  rate  of  our  deficit  increase  has  slowed  since  Obama  took  office,  and  our  GDP  increased.    3.  It  will  actually  bring  everyone's  cost  down,  including  those  who  pay  for  it,  including  you  if  you  pay  for  it.  Under  the  current  system  we  pay  the  most,  including  you,  for  the  33rd  ranked  healthcare  in  the  world.  It  is  a  retarded  system  and  had  to  be  changed  and  Obama  has  been  the  only  President  strong  enough  to  do  such.    4.  Again,  so  in  spite  of  the  chart  I  linked  clearly  showing  the  job  situation  has  steadily  improved  since  Obama  has  been  in  office,  you  choose  to  hate  him  based  on  some  vague  future  fear  fully  imagined  in  your  fevered  head.  And  I'm  sure  you  blame  Bush's  job  loss  on  Clinton,  makes  perfect  sense  ._.    5.  Wow,  that's  amazing,  don't  let  other  conservatives  hear  you  give  him  credit  for  something,  they'll  lynch  or  pray  for  your  soul  or  exorcise  you  or  some  other  crazy  ass  thing.    Next  section:    This  is  to  point  out  that  he's  doing  stuff  not  assoiciated  with  sacrificing  kittens  to  satan  or  speaking  to  Hitler's  ghost  about  ways  of  turning  America  into  a  socialist  nation  (that  doesn't  make  sense  on  purpose).  And  that  it  is  nice  to  have  a  president  not  born  into  it  and  who  actually  has  a  clue  what  he's  doing.    And  since  you  do  agree  on  some  things,  I'm  not  going  through  point  by  point  unless  you  have  something  specific  you  would  like  to  debate.	0
I  love  him  too.  He  has  a  brown  skin,  it  make  you  think  about  the  strong  and  health  :)	0
1.  He  was  born  in  America  2.  He's  gotten  things  done  nobody  really  notices  and  3.  He's  NOT  hitler!	0
Okay,  so  you  say  "he's  a  nice  guy,  but  I  don't  support  his  views,  therefore  he's  Hitler.	0
I  like  Obama  .  And  I  think  he  has  great  Leadership  Quality.	0
obama  is  a  good  president    bush  was  a  bad  president    obama  is  making  USA  more  modern  whit  gay  mary  and  higher  taxes.    homosexual's  have  the  same  equal  right  as  heterosexual's    and  high  taxes  is  good  without  taxes  how  in  hell  will  you  get  money  to  the  schools  and  hospitals.    the  country  with  good  economy  like  in  Sweden  we  have  34  procent  taxes  and  in  USA  you  only  have  7  procent    thats  ridicules	0
I’m  a  Dr  Ron  Paul  kind  of  guy.  I  don’t  vote  based  on  the  better  of  two  evils.

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.      Because  everyone  who  disagrees  with  you  must  not  be  involved  in  reality...    As  for  your  list  of  "accomplishments"  it  was  rather  clever  of  you  to  use  a  link  to  another  forums  and  by  doing  so  hiding  the  fact  that  the  list  is  from  DailyKos.    I  wish  I  could  color  code  stuff,  but  bold  will  represent  things  that  are  nothing  special  or  would  have  most  likely  been  done  by  McCain  and  italics  will  represent  something  that  should  not  be  the  government's  job  or  something  that  is  not  even  an  accomplishment.      1.

Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?      Cutting  taxes  is  something  that  just  about  any  leader  would  do  in  a  recession,  its  the  future  tax  hikes  to  cancel  out  the  huge  deficits  that  people  are  pissed  about.      2.    Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually  shrinking  the  size  of  government.      $82.69  billion  dollar  deficits  this  April,  though  it  is  nice  to  see  the  military  industrial  complex  get  a  kick  in  the  balls.      3.    Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.

I'm  sure  the  free-riders  in  this  country  will  love  it  and  those  who  realize  that  we  have  no  way  to  pay  for  it  will  hate.      4.

I  oppose  the  war,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  recent  success.      And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending      Trying  to  make  agencies  more  efficient  is  not  a  new  concept.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      See  above.    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    I'll  give  him  credit...  though  if  women  are  to  except  maternity  leave  then  they  ought  to  expect  lesser  pay.      1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    Good.      1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB      McCain  would  have  likely  done  something  similar.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;  reporting  full  information      Seeing  as  every  tv  station  not  named  Fox  is  in  the  tank  for  him  this  is  not  much  of  accomplishment.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  covering  the  return  of  fallen  soldiers  to  Dover  AFB;  the  media  is  now  permitted  to  do  so  pending  adherence  to  respectful  rules  and  approval  of  fallen  soldier's  family    Good.      1.The  White  House  and  federal  government  are  respecting  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act      Until  what  goes  on  behind  closed  doors  with  the  Federal  Reserve  and  Obama's  negotiations  with  Unions  and  Democrats  this  is  not  much  of  an  accomplishment.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      Really?  They  are  counting  this  as  an  accomplishment?    1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House    I  like  this  one.    1.Limits  on  White  House  aides  working  for  lobbyists  after  their  tenure  in  the  administration    There  are  still  loop  holes  but  if  this  policy  works  I'll  give  him  credit.      1.Ended  the  previous  stop-loss  policy  that  kept  soldiers  in  Iraq/Afghanistan  longer  than  their  enlistment  date      McCain  might  have  done  something  like  this,  but  I'll  give  Obama  credit.    1.Phasing  out  the  expensive  F-22  war  plane  and  other  outdated  weapons  systems,  which  weren't  even  used  or  needed  in  Iraq/Afghanistan    1.Removed  restrictions  on  embryonic  stem-cell  research      1.Federal  support  for  stem-cell  and  new  biomedical  research      I  don't  mind  stem-cell  research,  but  tax  payers  should  not  pay  for  it.        1.New  federal  funding  for  science  and  research  labs      Not  their  job  to  do  so.    1.States  are  permitted  to  enact  federal  fuel  efficiency  standards  above  federal  standards    I  would  respect  this  if  he  had  a  consistent  record  as  to  what  the  states  are  allowed  to.    1.Increased  infrastructure  spending  (roads,  bridges,  power  plants)  after  years  of  neglect      1.Funds  for  high-speed,  broadband  Internet  access  to  K-12  schools      Not  government's  job.      1.New  funds  for  school  construction      Not  government's  job,  the  schools  still  suck  anyways.        1.The  prison  at  Guantanamo  Bay  is  being  phased  out      This  one  is  just  fucking  retarded  and  is  nothing  more  then  a  PR  move.  If  he  wants  to  change  the  prison's  policies  then  that  is  one  thing,  but  closing  down  a  prison  only  to  send  the  prisoners  elsewhere  is  just  stupid.        1.US  Auto  industry  rescue  plan      Propping  up  failing  companies  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Housing  rescue  plan      He  still  needs  to  fix  Fannie  and  Freddie.      1.$789  billion  economic  stimulus  plan      The  tax  cut  parts  were  good,  the  rest  not  so  much.      1.The  public  can  meet  with  federal  housing  insurers  to  refinance  (the  new  plan  can  be  completed  in  one  day)  a  mortgage  if  they  are  having  trouble  paying      1.US  financial  and  banking  rescue  plan      Not  government's  job.    1.The  secret  detention  facilities  in  Eastern  Europe  and  elsewhere  are  being  closed    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  policy;  the  US  now  has  a  no  torture  policy  and  is  in  compliance  with  the  Geneva  Convention  standards    Good      1.Better  body  armor  is  now  being  provided  to  our  troops      McCain  would  have  done  the  same.    1.The  missile  defense  program  is  being  cut  by  $1.4  billion  in  2010    Good.      1.Restarted  the  nuclear  nonproliferation  talks  and  building  back  up  the  nuclear  inspection  infrastructure/protocols      New  policy  with  new  president,  nothing  special.    1.Reengaged  in  the  treaties/agreements  to  protect  the  Antarctic    Protect  it  from  what?      1.Reengaged  in  the  agreements/talks  on  global  warming  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions      More  bull  shit  regulations  from  self  righteous  environmentalists.        1.Visited  more  countries  and  met  with  more  world  leaders  than  any  president  in  his  first  six  months  in  office      And  now  they  like  us  more...  so  what?        1.Successful  release  of  US  captain  held  by  Somali  pirates;  authorized  the  SEALS  to  do  their  job      Do  you  really  think  that  a  Republican  would  have  hesitated  to  have  the  SEALS  do  their  job?      1.US  Navy  increasing  patrols  off  Somali  coast      Do  you  really  think  that  a  Republican  would  have  hesitated  to  increased  military  presence?        1.Attractive  tax  write-offs  for  those  who  buy  hybrid  automobiles      Preferential  treatment  to  his  environmental  followers  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Cash  for  clunkers  program  offers  vouchers  to  trade  in  fuel  inefficient,  polluting  old  cars  for  new  cars;  stimulated  auto  sales      Not  the  government's  job,  no  way  to  pay  for  the  program,  Japan  automakers  love  us  now.    1.Announced  plans  to  purchase  fuel  efficient  American-made  fleet  for  the  federal  government      1.Expanded  the  SCHIP  program  to  cover  health  care  for  4  million  more  children      Not  government's  job.      1.Signed  national  service  legislation;

 the  new  policy  is  to  promote  in-sourcing  to  bring  jobs  back    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  practice  of  protecting  credit  card  companies;  in  place  of  it  are  new  consumer  protections  from  credit  card  industry's  predatory  practices    Good.      1.Energy  producing  plants  must  begin  preparing  to  produce  15%  of  their  energy  from  renewable  sources      Not  government's  job.      1.Lower  drug  costs  for  seniors      Not  government's  job.    1.Ended  the  previous  practice  of  forbidding  Medicare  from  negotiating  with  drug  manufacturers  for  cheaper  drugs;

I’m  a  Dr  Ron  Paul  kind  of  guy.  I  don’t  vote  based  on  the  better  of  two  evils.  I’m  from  Texas  and  I’ve  never  voted  for  bush  nor  did  I  ever  vote  for  his  dump  ass  daddy.  I  really  could  not  vote  for  obama  because  once  he  signed  his  name  for  the  bailout  that  was  a  red  flag  enough  for  me  and  it  really  should  have  been  for  all  of  America.

Obama  is  a    socialist  and  populist  ,  who  hates  the  idea  of  freedom,  responsibility  and  free  choice.  He  wants  government  to  takeover  everything.---------------------	1
People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.      Because  everyone  who  disagrees  with  you  must  not  be  involved  in  reality...    As  for  your  list  of  "accomplishments"  it  was  rather  clever  of  you  to  use  a  link  to  another  forums  and  by  doing  so  hiding  the  fact  that  the  list  is  from  DailyKos.    I  wish  I  could  color  code  stuff,  but  bold  will  represent  things  that  are  nothing  special  or  would  have  most  likely  been  done  by  McCain  and  italics  will  represent  something  that  should  not  be  the  government's  job  or  something  that  is  not  even  an  accomplishment.      1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?      Cutting  taxes  is  something  that  just  about  any  leader  would  do  in  a  recession,  its  the  future  tax  hikes  to  cancel  out  the  huge  deficits  that  people  are  pissed  about.      2.    Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually  shrinking  the  size  of  government.      $82.69  billion  dollar  deficits  this  April,  though  it  is  nice  to  see  the  military  industrial  complex  get  a  kick  in  the  balls.      3.    Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.      I'm  sure  the  free-riders  in  this  country  will  love  it  and  those  who  realize  that  we  have  no  way  to  pay  for  it  will  hate.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Keynesian  economics:  Fix  something  in  the  short  run  only  to  see  it  fail  even  more  in  the  long  run.      5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    I  oppose  the  war,  but  I'll  give  him  credit  for  recent  success.      And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending      Trying  to  make  agencies  more  efficient  is  not  a  new  concept.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      See  above.    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    I'll  give  him  credit...  though  if  women  are  to  except  maternity  leave  then  they  ought  to  expect  lesser  pay.      1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    Good.      1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB      McCain  would  have  likely  done  something  similar.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;  reporting  full  information      Seeing  as  every  tv  station  not  named  Fox  is  in  the  tank  for  him  this  is  not  much  of  accomplishment.      1.Ended  media  blackout  on  covering  the  return  of  fallen  soldiers  to  Dover  AFB;  the  media  is  now  permitted  to  do  so  pending  adherence  to  respectful  rules  and  approval  of  fallen  soldier's  family    Good.      1.The  White  House  and  federal  government  are  respecting  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act      Until  what  goes  on  behind  closed  doors  with  the  Federal  Reserve  and  Obama's  negotiations  with  Unions  and  Democrats  this  is  not  much  of  an  accomplishment.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      Really?  They  are  counting  this  as  an  accomplishment?    1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House    I  like  this  one.    1.Limits  on  White  House  aides  working  for  lobbyists  after  their  tenure  in  the  administration    There  are  still  loop  holes  but  if  this  policy  works  I'll  give  him  credit.      1.Ended  the  previous  stop-loss  policy  that  kept  soldiers  in  Iraq/Afghanistan  longer  than  their  enlistment  date      McCain  might  have  done  something  like  this,  but  I'll  give  Obama  credit.    1.Phasing  out  the  expensive  F-22  war  plane  and  other  outdated  weapons  systems,  which  weren't  even  used  or  needed  in  Iraq/Afghanistan    1.Removed  restrictions  on  embryonic  stem-cell  research      1.Federal  support  for  stem-cell  and  new  biomedical  research      I  don't  mind  stem-cell  research,  but  tax  payers  should  not  pay  for  it.        1.New  federal  funding  for  science  and  research  labs      Not  their  job  to  do  so.    1.States  are  permitted  to  enact  federal  fuel  efficiency  standards  above  federal  standards    I  would  respect  this  if  he  had  a  consistent  record  as  to  what  the  states  are  allowed  to.    1.Increased  infrastructure  spending  (roads,  bridges,  power  plants)  after  years  of  neglect      1.Funds  for  high-speed,  broadband  Internet  access  to  K-12  schools      Not  government's  job.      1.New  funds  for  school  construction      Not  government's  job,  the  schools  still  suck  anyways.        1.The  prison  at  Guantanamo  Bay  is  being  phased  out      This  one  is  just  fucking  retarded  and  is  nothing  more  then  a  PR  move.  If  he  wants  to  change  the  prison's  policies  then  that  is  one  thing,  but  closing  down  a  prison  only  to  send  the  prisoners  elsewhere  is  just  stupid.        1.US  Auto  industry  rescue  plan      Propping  up  failing  companies  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Housing  rescue  plan      He  still  needs  to  fix  Fannie  and  Freddie.      1.$789  billion  economic  stimulus  plan      The  tax  cut  parts  were  good,  the  rest  not  so  much.      1.The  public  can  meet  with  federal  housing  insurers  to  refinance  (the  new  plan  can  be  completed  in  one  day)  a  mortgage  if  they  are  having  trouble  paying      1.US  financial  and  banking  rescue  plan      Not  government's  job.    1.The  secret  detention  facilities  in  Eastern  Europe  and  elsewhere  are  being  closed    Good.    1.Ended  the  previous  policy;  the  US  now  has  a  no  torture  policy  and  is  in  compliance  with  the  Geneva  Convention  standards    Good      1.Better  body  armor  is  now  being  provided  to  our  troops      McCain  would  have  done  the  same.    1.The  missile  defense  program  is  being  cut  by  $1.4  billion  in  2010    Good.      1.Restarted  the  nuclear  nonproliferation  talks  and  building  back  up  the  nuclear  inspection  infrastructure/protocols      New  policy  with  new  president,  nothing  special.    1.Reengaged  in  the  treaties/agreements  to  protect  the  Antarctic    Protect  it  from  what?      1.Reengaged  in  the  agreements/talks  on  global  warming  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions      More  bull  shit  regulations  from  self  righteous  environmentalists.        1.Visited  more  countries  and  met  with  more  world  leaders  than  any  president  in  his  first  six  months  in  office      And  now  they  like  us  more...  so  what?        1.Successful  release  of  US  captain  held  by  Somali  pirates;  authorized  the  SEALS  to  do  their  job      Do  you  really  think  that  a  Republican  would  have  hesitated  to  have  the  SEALS  do  their  job?      1.US  Navy  increasing  patrols  off  Somali  coast      Do  you  really  think  that  a  Republican  would  have  hesitated  to  increased  military  presence?        1.Attractive  tax  write-offs  for  those  who  buy  hybrid  automobiles      Preferential  treatment  to  his  environmental  followers  is  not  an  accomplishment.        1.Cash  for  clunkers  program  offers  vouchers  to  trade  in  fuel  inefficient,  polluting  old  cars  for  new  cars;  stimulated  auto  sales      Not  the  government's  job,  no  way  to  pay  for  the  program,  Japan  automakers  love  us  now.    1.Announced  plans  to  purchase  fuel  efficient  American-made  fleet  for  the  federal  government      1.Expanded  the  SCHIP  program  to  cover  health  care  for  4  million  more  children      Not  government's  job.      1.Signed  national  service  legislation;

Anyways,  he  appointed  some  bitch  that  he  knew  would  agree  with  him  on  most  issues,  that  is  not  an  accomplishment  that  is  politicizing  the  court,  though  that  is  nothing  new.      1.Authorized  construction/opening  of  additional  health  centers  to  care  for  veterans      McCain.      1.Limited  salaries  of  senior  White  House  aides;  cut  to  $100,000      They  should  be  making  a  lot  less.      1.Renewed  loan  guarantees  for  Israel      Fuck  Israel.      1.Changed  the  failing/status  quo  military  command  in  Afghanistan      New  president,  new  policy.      1.Deployed  additional  troops  to  Afghanistan      McCain.    1.New  Afghan  War  policy  that  limits  aerial  bombing  and  prioritizes  aid,  development  of  infrastructure,  diplomacy,  and  good  government  practices  by  Afghans    New  president,  new  policy,  but  since  this  a  really  good  policy  I'll  give  him  credit.    1.Announced  the  long-term  development  of  a  national  energy  grid  with  renewable  sources  and  cleaner,  efficient  energy  production      1.Returned  money  authorized  for  refurbishment  of  White  House  offices  and      private  living  quarters      PR  move.      1.Paid  for  redecoration  of  White  House  living  quarters  out  of  his  own  pocket      Really?

And  since  this  is  the  Kos  what  they  mean  by  "reform"  is  cap  and  trade  that  will  cause  electricity  costs  to  sky  rocket  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  large  companies  to  continue  to  pollute  as  long  as  they  are  willing  to  buy  credits.      1.Has  announced  his  intention  to  push  for  education  reform      I  wasn't  aware  that  simply  announcing  a  plan  was  an  accomplishment.[SEP]MY  SENTIMENTS  EXACTLY!!!!!!!  &lt;-----------------------------------  --[SEP]...  you  realize  wolfbite  supported  about  half  the  points  in  that  long  list.

Just  for  the  sake  of  the  argument,  even  if  Obama  is  not  socialist,  unequivocally,  he  is  a  populist.  I  know  you  will  agree  with  this.[SEP]I  know  you  will  agree  with  this.      Everyone  in  politics  is  a  populist  these  days.  When  you  have  Sarah  Palin  talking  about  "real  Americans",  the  distinction  between  wall  street  and  main  street  -  blah,  blah,  blah...  it's  populist  rhetoric.  Who  cares  if  he's  a  populist?  Is  that  a  mark  against  him  now?    But  besides  this,  your  initial  argument  is  absurd.  And  if  it's  not,  please  justify  it.	0

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.	1
Obama  is  a    socialist  and  populist  ,  who  hates  the  idea  of  freedom,  responsibility  and  free  choice.

Frankly,  that's  better  than  video  games  and  hummers  and  all  the  other  crap  that  Americans  buy  when  we  get  to  keep  our  own  money.    What  supply-siders  don't  seem  to  understand  is  that  government  jobs  are  not  a  dead  weight  on  economic  growth.  If  we  employ  more  teachers  and  firefighters  and  peanut-butter-factory  inspectors,  they  will  take  their  paychecks  and  go  to  the  mall  and  buy  the  crap  that  private  investment  tends  to  favor.  Vital  services  and  crap  can  coexist.    Any  decent  country  needs  a  balance  between  public  and  private  investment.  Yes,  if  the  government  runs  everything,  you  get  a  dreary  Soviet-style  morass  that  makes  almost  everyone  poor.  But  the  starve-the-government-to-death  (except  for  the  war  machine  and  corporate  welfare  queens)  philosophy  of  the  Bush  era  was  leading  us  to  a  situation  in  which  the  rich  were  counting  their  dollars  in  gated  communities,  while  the  rest  of  society  was  going  to  hell  --  even  while  enjoying  the  video  games.    Thank  goodness  that  the  trickle-down  economy  collapsed  from  its  own  incompetence  and  corruption.

Thank  goodness  the  American  people  elected  Barack  Obama  to  rebuild  a  society  we  can  be  proud  of.[SEP]Well,  your  excused!!    Sure,  bankers  and  unscrupulous  speculators  and  con  artists  destroyed  many  jobs  indirectly  with  their  risk  and  irresponsible  business  decisions,  but  those  jobs  were  directly  lost  to  fear,  inactivity  and  no  confidence  in  the  economy.    However,  the  real  problem  is  the  Federal  Reserve,  the  central  bank  who  provided  the  money  for  the  bailouts  and  were  supported  by  the  government.  If  the  Fed  were  to  end,  sound  money  would  reign  supreme  and  end  the  influx  of  inflation  and  bailouts.  If  bailouts  were  not  guaranteed  by  the  Fed  and  the  government,  these  banks  would  have  strong  incentives  to  practice  responsibility  and  prudent  business  decisions;  plus,  the  government  passed  laws  requiring  banks  give  loans  out  despite  the  ability  to  pay.    The  problem  with  government  stepping  in  or  demand  side  economics  boosting  investment  are  3  factors.  One  is  inflation  unless  you  love  inflation,  in  order  to  reinvest,  more  money  needs  to  be  printed;  thus,  it  devalues  the  currency,  and  it  actually  hurts  the  poor  and  middle  class  in  the  long  run  because  wages  increases  can't  keep  up.  Two  is  higher  taxes.  Since  the  government  has  very  little  ownership,  they  don't  own  assets.  They  have  to  tax  to  pay  for  these  investments.  Three  is  if  no  higher  taxes,  then  it  is  increasing  debt,  which  is  just  as  bad  as  inflation.    I  completely  agree  that  the  war  machine  and  corporate  welfare  is  wrong.  War  can  only  be  funded  by  unappropriated  or  levied  resources  where  the  government  must  print  more  money  in  order  to  pay  for  wars.  Corporate  welfare  simply  means  no  bailouts  to  failing  companies  and  support  those  with  sound  business  decisions.	1
Obama  is  a    socialist  and  populist  ,  who  hates  the  idea  of  freedom,  responsibility  and  free  choice.  He  wants  government  to  takeover  everything.---------------------[SEP]It  has  been  said  before...  it  will  be  repeated  many  many  more  times.      Learn  what  socialism  means.      It's  like  you  have  some  weird  form  of  OCD  that  compels  you  to  yell  "SOCIALIST!"  at  anyone  to  the  left  of  you  politically  or  something.[SEP]WOW,  JoeCalvary  was  right.  Liberals  resort  to  name  calling.  Now  I  am  OCD.  I  know  what  socialism  means.      Just  for  the  sake  of  the  argument,  even  if  Obama  is  not  socialist,  unequivocally,  he  is  a  populist.  I  know  you  will  agree  with  this.[SEP]Oh  what  and  George  Bush  giving  tax  cuts  to  the  wealthy  isn't  populist?  The  whole  point  of  a  president  giving  tax  cuts  is  to  become  more  popular.  Bush  Sr.  raised  taxes  and  he  lost  the  election  and  Georgie  Boy  took  this  too  heart  and  decided  that  in  an  attempt  to  not  repeat  his  father's  political  mistake,  the  best  thing  to  do  would  be  tax  cuts.  Your  whole  populist  argument  is  flawed.[SEP]Maybe  you  need  to  look  up  populist  again.  Here  I  will  do  it  for  you.  Social  and  political  system  change  that  favors  "the  people"  over  "the  elites.  Basically,  taking  money  from  the  rich  to  the  poor.    Plus,  how  do  you  think  jobs  are  created?  They  are  created  by  magical  fairy  dust.  Are  they  created  by  government?  Sure  some.  But  the  majority  of  jobs  are  created  the  wealthy.[SEP]the  wealthy  wouldn't  be  wealthy  and  wouldn't  create  any  jobs  if  there  wasn't  a  strong  middle  class  creating  demand  for  their  products.	0
Obama  is  a    socialist  and  populist  ,  who  hates  the  idea  of  freedom,  responsibility  and  free  choice.  He  wants  government  to  takeover  everything.---------------------[SEP]Ok,  arguments  like  this  are  what  give  anti-Obama  people  a  bad  name.      So  we  know  you're  not  just  breathing  hot  air  out  of  your  mouth,  can  you  explain  what  you  mean  by  "socialist"  and  "populist"?  Do  you  know  what  those  words  mean?  Can  you  cite  some  instances  where  he  has  demonstrated  a  hatred  of  freedom  or  free  choice?  What  about  responsibility?  No  I  didn't  think  so.  He  may  have  no  idea  how  to  run  the  country,  he  may  have  just  ridden  a  wave  of  popularity  into  the  office,  and  he  may  have  the  wrong  agenda,  but  calling  him  a  socialist  who  hates  freedom  is  absolutely  ridiculous.    P.S,  a  populist  is  one  who  has  the  interests  of  THE  PEOPLE  at  heart.  Populism  has  NO  ties  to  Socialism,  do  your  research  and  gtfo  the  internet	0

Populism  has  NO  ties  to  Socialism,  do  your  research  and  gtfo  the  internet[SEP]Where  Obama  demonstrated  the  hatred  in  free  of  choice.  Does  the  new  health  care  bill  maybe  rings  a  bell  or  are  you  some  tree  hugging  government  loving  liberal?  Yeah,  that  is  what  I  thought.    Regardless  what  your  liberal  feelings  of  on  health  care,  health  care  coverage  is  a  free  choice,  and  this  bill  coercive  measures  in  order  to  purchase  of  health  care  insurance  or  face  fines  and  penalty,  and  violates  the  Commerce  Clause  of  United  States  Constitution,  Article  I,  Section  8,  Clause  3.  Not  to  mention  it  also  violates  the  Tenth  Amendment  to  United  States  Constitution.    gtfo  the  internet  is  something  a  high  school  kid  would  say.  YEAH,  good  one.  A  populist  is  is  a  type  of  political-social  thought  that  juxtaposes  "the  people"  against  "the  elites",  and  urges  social  and  political  system  changes.  Basically,  take  from  the  rich  and  give  to  the  poor.    As  for  socialism,  it  is  government  ownership  of  in  the  production  and  administration  of  a  organization  and  the  reallocation  of  resources.    P.S.  maybe  you  should  do  your  research  and  understand  that  freedom  and  responsibility  is  not  just  political,  but  economic.	0
People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]Your  infatuation  with  Obama  is  either  blinding  you  completely  or  you  are  purposely  distorting  facts.      Tea  Party  weirdos      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.[SEP]I'm  not  infatuated  at  all,  in  fact  I  think  he  has  been  too  moderate.  But  I'm  not  a  retard  who  lives  in  an  alternate  universe  where  Obama  has  horns.  He's  doing  a  really  good  job  especially  considering  what  he  was  left  with.      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      And  exactly  what  part  of  the  constitution  has  Obama  not  followed?  That  is  why  they  are  weird,  they  live  under  a  number  of  delusions,  that  the  government  has  been  acting  unconstitutionally  only  one  of  many.  Here  are  some  of  the  other  tea  party  delusions:    1.  Obama  was  not  born  here    2.  Obama  is  taking  your  guns  when  in  fact  he's  relaxed  gun  laws.    3.  Obama  has  raised  their  taxes,  when  in  fact  everyone  paid  less  taxes  last  year.    4.  Only  poor  black  people  who  want  free  stuff  voted  for  him  even  though  he  won  by  one  of  the  largest  majorities  in  history    I'm  sure  there  are  more  but  I  try  not  to  talk  to  the  village  idiots.    Anyway,  yes,  on  average  every  one  really  did  pay  less  taxes.  I  realize  that  ruins  many  of  those  potato  chip  stuffed  asses  reason  for  leaving  their  recliner  and  making  a  colorful  sign,  but  it  is  the  truth.    Further,  half  the  idiot  tea  party  crying  about  "Gov'ment  tooks  my  money!  WAH!"  Actually  benefit  from  one  government  program  or  another,  and  would  be  crying  even  harder  if  the  government  took  away  their  Medicare  or  social  security.    2.  No,  spending  really  has  been  cut.  The  stimulus  was  passed  under  Bush,  and  under  Obama  most  of  the  money  has  been  repaid.  It's  yet  another  silly  tea  bagger  delusion,  this  idea  that  only  Obama  passed  the  stimulus,  and  that  the  stimulus  isn't  the  only  thing  that  saved  us  from  another  great  depression.  Every  expert  says  without  it  we  would  be  living  in  Hoover  tents  right  now.  Anyway,      part  of  the  problem  I  see,  is  that  people  like  yourself  when  I  say  "spending  has  been  cut"  you  are  comparing  spending  now,  to  spending  in  magical  fairy  land,  while  I  on  the  other  hand  am  dealing  with  reality,  and  the  spending  during  the  Bush  years.    3.  Uh,  no.    Every    country  that  has  a  similar  plan,  and  usually  an  even  more  liberal  plan  than  what  was  passed  here,  spends  less  per  capita  on  healthcare.  That  means  they  have  more  money.  That  means  they  are  less  likely  to  have  financial  meltdowns  due  to  healthcare.  Again,  you  do  not  argue  in  reality.  Look  at  any  chart  of  healthcare  spending  and  you  will  see  the  US  spent  nearly  twice  as  much  as  any  country  before  this  was  passed.    4.  Oh  my  god,  are  you  literally  retarded?  I  mean  I  had  my  suspicions  when  I  saw  your  name,  looks  like  a  gay  dating  site  title,  but  that  aside  I  didn't  really  think  you  were  literally  retarded  until  I  saw  your  number  4  point  there.      Bush  was  handed  the  best  economy  in  the  history  of  the  US  due  to  Clinton's  policies.  This  massive  surplus  was  literally  squandered  by  that  monkey  Bush  in  about  3  years.  Due  to  what  you  call  "stimulus"  which  is  really  just  tax  cuts  for  people  who  don't  need  them  and  won't  put  the  money  back  into  the  economy  and  insane  deregulation  that  started  with  Reagan,  we  went  from  the  greatest  US  economy  in  history  to  the  second  worst  in  US  history.    It  is  truly  an  accomplishment  in  itself,  how  one  crappy  president  with  daddy  issues  can  bring  an  entire  economy  to  it's  knees  so  quickly.  Now  we  have  an  intelligent  person  in  office,  and  for  the  first  time  in  about  6  years  each  month  is  showing  less  job  losses  than  the  last,  and  in  some  instances  actual  job  gains,    and  still  you  preach  Bush  era  economic  strategy.  It  is  truly  mind  boggling  how  one  can  be  so  completely  clueless.    Honestly  I'm  bored  of  you  now.    I  will  add  though  to  your  "bigot"  comment.  You  do  realize  that  if  Obama  were  not  black  this  fake  corporate  run  grass  roots  tea  bagger  bs  would  not  happen.  Sure  some  are  just  clueless  idiots  who  live  in  a  Faux  Noise  media  alternate  Universe  and  have  no  idea  how  backwards  their  view  of  what  is  going  on  is,  but  most  are  pissed  because  "real  America"  as  they  put  it,  in  there  view  does  not  include  black  people.  Disliking  people  because  of  their  opinions  is  far  different  than  comparing  a  democratically  elected  president  to  Hitler  and  insisting  he  was  not  born  here  all  because  of  the  color  of  his  skin.    And  I  don't  want  to  hear  the  old  line  "no  that's  not  it  uh,  uh,  it's  his  policies."    Bullshit.  Where  was  the  tea  party  in  the  Clinton  years?  Where  was  the  tea  party  when  Bush  with  the  help  of  that  troll  Cheyenne  destroyed  the  strongest  economy  in  the  world?  Nowhere,  because  Clinton  and  Bush  are  white.  Bigot  indeed.	0

All  of  government(except  like  CIA  operatives  or  something)  should  be  transparent,  back  rooms  should  be  made  of  glass  so  to  speak.

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]Your  infatuation  with  Obama  is  either  blinding  you  completely  or  you  are  purposely  distorting  facts.      Tea  Party  weirdos      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.[SEP]I'm  not  infatuated  at  all,  in  fact  I  think  he  has  been  too  moderate.  But  I'm  not  a  retard  who  lives  in  an  alternate  universe  where  Obama  has  horns.  He's  doing  a  really  good  job  especially  considering  what  he  was  left  with.      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      And  exactly  what  part  of  the  constitution  has  Obama  not  followed?  That  is  why  they  are  weird,  they  live  under  a  number  of  delusions,  that  the  government  has  been  acting  unconstitutionally  only  one  of  many.  Here  are  some  of  the  other  tea  party  delusions:    1.  Obama  was  not  born  here    2.  Obama  is  taking  your  guns  when  in  fact  he's  relaxed  gun  laws.    3.  Obama  has  raised  their  taxes,  when  in  fact  everyone  paid  less  taxes  last  year.    4.  Only  poor  black  people  who  want  free  stuff  voted  for  him  even  though  he  won  by  one  of  the  largest  majorities  in  history    I'm  sure  there  are  more  but  I  try  not  to  talk  to  the  village  idiots.    Anyway,  yes,  on  average  every  one  really  did  pay  less  taxes.  I  realize  that  ruins  many  of  those  potato  chip  stuffed  asses  reason  for  leaving  their  recliner  and  making  a  colorful  sign,  but  it  is  the  truth.    Further,  half  the  idiot  tea  party  crying  about  "Gov'ment  tooks  my  money!  WAH!"  Actually  benefit  from  one  government  program  or  another,  and  would  be  crying  even  harder  if  the  government  took  away  their  Medicare  or  social  security.    2.  No,  spending  really  has  been  cut.  The  stimulus  was  passed  under  Bush,  and  under  Obama  most  of  the  money  has  been  repaid.  It's  yet  another  silly  tea  bagger  delusion,  this  idea  that  only  Obama  passed  the  stimulus,  and  that  the  stimulus  isn't  the  only  thing  that  saved  us  from  another  great  depression.  Every  expert  says  without  it  we  would  be  living  in  Hoover  tents  right  now.  Anyway,      part  of  the  problem  I  see,  is  that  people  like  yourself  when  I  say  "spending  has  been  cut"  you  are  comparing  spending  now,  to  spending  in  magical  fairy  land,  while  I  on  the  other  hand  am  dealing  with  reality,  and  the  spending  during  the  Bush  years.    3.  Uh,  no.    Every    country  that  has  a  similar  plan,  and  usually  an  even  more  liberal  plan  than  what  was  passed  here,  spends  less  per  capita  on  healthcare.  That  means  they  have  more  money.  That  means  they  are  less  likely  to  have  financial  meltdowns  due  to  healthcare.  Again,  you  do  not  argue  in  reality.  Look  at  any  chart  of  healthcare  spending  and  you  will  see  the  US  spent  nearly  twice  as  much  as  any  country  before  this  was  passed.    4.  Oh  my  god,  are  you  literally  retarded?  I  mean  I  had  my  suspicions  when  I  saw  your  name,  looks  like  a  gay  dating  site  title,  but  that  aside  I  didn't  really  think  you  were  literally  retarded  until  I  saw  your  number  4  point  there.      Bush  was  handed  the  best  economy  in  the  history  of  the  US  due  to  Clinton's  policies.  This  massive  surplus  was  literally  squandered  by  that  monkey  Bush  in  about  3  years.  Due  to  what  you  call  "stimulus"  which  is  really  just  tax  cuts  for  people  who  don't  need  them  and  won't  put  the  money  back  into  the  economy  and  insane  deregulation  that  started  with  Reagan,  we  went  from  the  greatest  US  economy  in  history  to  the  second  worst  in  US  history.    It  is  truly  an  accomplishment  in  itself,  how  one  crappy  president  with  daddy  issues  can  bring  an  entire  economy  to  it's  knees  so  quickly.  Now  we  have  an  intelligent  person  in  office,  and  for  the  first  time  in  about  6  years  each  month  is  showing  less  job  losses  than  the  last,  and  in  some  instances  actual  job  gains,    and  still  you  preach  Bush  era  economic  strategy.  It  is  truly  mind  boggling  how  one  can  be  so  completely  clueless.    Honestly  I'm  bored  of  you  now.    I  will  add  though  to  your  "bigot"  comment.  You  do  realize  that  if  Obama  were  not  black  this  fake  corporate  run  grass  roots  tea  bagger  bs  would  not  happen.  Sure  some  are  just  clueless  idiots  who  live  in  a  Faux  Noise  media  alternate  Universe  and  have  no  idea  how  backwards  their  view  of  what  is  going  on  is,  but  most  are  pissed  because  "real  America"  as  they  put  it,  in  there  view  does  not  include  black  people.  Disliking  people  because  of  their  opinions  is  far  different  than  comparing  a  democratically  elected  president  to  Hitler  and  insisting  he  was  not  born  here  all  because  of  the  color  of  his  skin.    And  I  don't  want  to  hear  the  old  line  "no  that's  not  it  uh,  uh,  it's  his  policies."    Bullshit.  Where  was  the  tea  party  in  the  Clinton  years?  Where  was  the  tea  party  when  Bush  with  the  help  of  that  troll  Cheyenne  destroyed  the  strongest  economy  in  the  world?  Nowhere,  because  Clinton  and  Bush  are  white.  Bigot  indeed.[SEP]I'm  sorry,  your  facts  are  almost  all  completely  made  up,  and  it  is  you,  sir  who  are  living  in  a  land  of  delusions.  I  would  respond  to  you  point  by  point,  but  I  attempted  that  and  it's  clearly  not  worth  the  effort.  Every  word  you  say  is  just  reiterated  talking  points  from  the  democratic  party.  I  don't  think  Bush  was  all  that,  he  did  some  terrible  things.  I  think  the  republicans  do  some  terrible  things.  I  can't  believe  how  blindly  you  are  following  not  just  one  party,  but  one  man.  Turn  off  the  internet,  turn  off  cnn,  start  doing  some  real  research  and  open  your  mind,  you'll  find  that  both  political  parties  and  all  politicians  are  corrupt.	1
Bailing  out  banks,  bailing  out  the  auto  industry  all  with  money  we  don't  have.      The  bailouts  were  passed  by  the  Bush  administration.

Keep  drinking  that  Kool-Aid![SEP]Uh...The  "Bush"  bailout  of  the  banks  was  done  at  the  request  of  then  president-elect  Obama.      That's  not  even  what  the  article  reports.  The  article  pertains  to  a  potential  (at  the  time)  Obama  request  for  additional  funds  not  already  released  in  the  Bailout  process  (that  was  allocated  in  the  Bailout).  The  Bailout  had  already  been  put  into  action  and  wasn't  done  at  the  request  of  Obama.  You're  interpretation  is  wrong.      The  GM  was  paid  back?!      Yes.  GM  ultimately  used  their  loaned  money  to  repay  their  loan.  Get  the  fuck  over  it.  The  next  time  you  take  out  a  loan  and  realize  you  don't  have  to  use  all  of  it,  make  sure  to  never  -  ever  -  use  any  of  the  residual  to  help  pay  back  your  loan.  There's  something  wrong  with  that,  according  to  you.      The  taxpayer  isn't  getting  jack  shit  paid  back.      My  assertion  was  that  taxpayer  money  was  returned,  not  that  it  was  being  returned  to  the  taxpayer.  We  let  go  of  that  money.

Obama  only  won  because  he  was  African  american  so  most  African  american  vote  him	1

People  are  ridiculous  on  the  right  now.  It's  turned  into  an  Orwelian  witch  hunt  with  no  basis  in  reality.    1.  Taxes  are  the  main  gripe  of  all  those  fat  pasty  Tea  Party  weirdos.  Yet  this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.  Where  were  these  lard  asses  when  there  was  a  white  guy  in  office?    2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut,  and  everyone  conveniently  ignored  that  Obama  finally  ended  the  f-22  program  which  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  elimante  but  couldn't  because  they  were  not  cool  enough  since  Bush  Sr.  In  fact  Obama  has  passed  60%  of  cuts,  much  more  than  Bush  Jr.  -  hence  actually    shrinking    the  size  of  government.    3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it  and  held  that  residing  government  in  great  esteem  in  subsequent  generations.  This  will  be  no  different.  If  nothing  else  he  has  already  assured  his  spot  in  world  history  as  a  great  American  President  for  this  alone  despite  knee-jerk  "there's  a  monster  in  your  closet"  reaction  from  the  perpetually  scared  right.    4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart    link    And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.    5.  We  are  leaving  Iraq,  and  we  are  doing  better  in  Afghanistan  since  Obama  took  office  now  that  we  are  actually  concentrating  on  the  terrorists  responsible  for  911  instead  of  chasing  Cheyene's  oil  interests.    And  here's  a  list  of  things  Obama  has  done,  some  may  not  agree  with  everything,  but  at  least  he  isn't  at  Camp  David  or  reading  to  Kindergartners  on  the  tax  payer's  dime:    1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending    1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices    1.Instituted  enforcement  for  equal  pay  for  women    1.Beginning  the  withdrawal  of  US  troops  from  Iraq    1.Families  of  fallen  soldiers  have  expenses  covered  to  be  on  hand  when  the  body  arrives  at  Dover  AFB    1.Ended  media  blackout  on  war  casualties;

If  nothing  else  Obama  is  at  least  into  the  job  and  trying  his  best.    I  happen  to  think  he's  doing  awsome,  even  if  one  disagrees,  this  hatred  cannot  possibly  be  based  in  reality.  It  can  only  be  the  result  of  some  deep  hatred  of  either  liberals  or  black  people  or  both,  or  a  complete  ignorance  of  the  real  world.[SEP]Your  infatuation  with  Obama  is  either  blinding  you  completely  or  you  are  purposely  distorting  facts.      Tea  Party  weirdos      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      this  very  year  is  the  least  taxes  Americans  have  paid  then  at  any  time  during  the  Bush  administration.      OK,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  purposeful  lie  or  you  just  don't  see  this.  Tax  rates  have  actually  gone  up  for  almost  everyone  paying  taxes,  but  we  are  in  a  massive  recession,  so  tax  revenue  is  down.  Your  statement  is  true  but  is  a  huge  manipulation  of  fact.  Ironically,  your  point  only  proves  why  the  Bush  tax  cuts  should  be  extended:  by  lowering  taxes  for  certain  income  brackets,  the  govt  tax  revenue  actually  goes  up.      2.  Spending  has  actually  been  cut      No.  Sure  he  cut  the  f-22  program,  but  the  stimulus  bill,  health  care,  and  a  myriad  of  other  programs  have  skyrocketed  federal  spending.  This  is  just  not  true.  Sorry.      3.  Every  nation  that  has  ever  passed  a  Healthcare  plan  similar  to  the  one  Obama  passed  was  happy  for  it      So  if  everyone  else  is  doing  it  we  should  too?  Most  of  these  countries  are  having  financial  meltdowns  because  of  massive  deficit  spending.      4.  Due  to  the  stimulus  package,  the  economy  is  improving.  Here  is  a  jobs  chart  link  And  that  is  actually  off,  we  actually  gained  200,000  jobs  in  January  the  most  recent  numbers  indicate.      Again,  no.  First  of  all,  200,000  jobs  gained  in  January  are  census  jobs  mostly.  Second,  the  stimulus  package  contained  almost  NO  stimulus.  It  CANNOT  stimulate  the  economy  because  it  was  almost  entirely  pork  barrel  spending  and  was  "stimulus"  in  name  only.  That  aside,  we  have  clearly  lost  jobs,  as  unemployment  has  gone  from  6%  to  10%.  Where  did  that  700  billion  dollars  go?  And  even  if  we  did  add  jobs,  700  billion  for  200k  jobs?  It  would  be  cheaper  to  give  $1  million  dollars  to  every  american.    Anyway,  I'm  gonna  skim  and  end,  because  I  think  I've  made  my  point.      1.Ordered  all  federal  agencies  to  undertake  a  study  and  make  recommendations  for  ways  to  cut  spending        Political  double  speak.  While  he  drastically  increases  spending  he  attempts  to  make  himself  look  good  by  ordering  reviews.      1.Ordered  a  review  of  all  federal  operations  to  identify  and  cut  wasteful  spending  and  practices      see  above.      1.Instructed  all  federal  agencies  to  promote  openness  and  transparency  as  much  as  possible      while  bills  like  the  1  trillion  dollar  health  care  bill  are  done  completely  behind  closed  doors.      1.Limits  on  lobbyist's  access  to  the  White  House      He  said.  But  we  have  seen  the  heaviest  lobbying  in  White  House  history  under  his  regime.    Anyway,  point  being  almost  everything  this  man  touches  turns  to  dust.  The  "budget  neutral"  health  care  bill  has  now  been  revealed  by  the  CBO  to  be  a  1  trillion  dollar  deficit.  We  are  spending  150%  of  our  GDP  in  deficit  spending  (Greece  is  collapsing  at  only  119%).  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  no  one  even  knows  what  it  means.  You  say  this  man  will  go  down  in  history.  This  is  undoubtedly  true.  He  will  go  down  as  the  man  who  in  four  years  decimated  the  US  economy.[SEP]I'm  not  infatuated  at  all,  in  fact  I  think  he  has  been  too  moderate.  But  I'm  not  a  retard  who  lives  in  an  alternate  universe  where  Obama  has  horns.  He's  doing  a  really  good  job  especially  considering  what  he  was  left  with.      It  is  weird  to  believe  in  constitutional  govt.  If  you  think  they're  weird,  give  us  reasons,  or  your  argument  is  not  credible  and  you  look  like  a  bigot  (someone  who  makes  decisions  without  facts).      And  exactly  what  part  of  the  constitution  has  Obama  not  followed?  That  is  why  they  are  weird,  they  live  under  a  number  of  delusions,  that  the  government  has  been  acting  unconstitutionally  only  one  of  many.  Here  are  some  of  the  other  tea  party  delusions:    1.  Obama  was  not  born  here    2.  Obama  is  taking  your  guns  when  in  fact  he's  relaxed  gun  laws.    3.  Obama  has  raised  their  taxes,  when  in  fact  everyone  paid  less  taxes  last  year.    4.  Only  poor  black  people  who  want  free  stuff  voted  for  him  even  though  he  won  by  one  of  the  largest  majorities  in  history    I'm  sure  there  are  more  but  I  try  not  to  talk  to  the  village  idiots.    Anyway,  yes,  on  average  every  one  really  did  pay  less  taxes.  I  realize  that  ruins  many  of  those  potato  chip  stuffed  asses  reason  for  leaving  their  recliner  and  making  a  colorful  sign,  but  it  is  the  truth.    Further,  half  the  idiot  tea  party  crying  about  "Gov'ment  tooks  my  money!  WAH!"  Actually  benefit  from  one  government  program  or  another,  and  would  be  crying  even  harder  if  the  government  took  away  their  Medicare  or  social  security.    2.  No,  spending  really  has  been  cut.  The  stimulus  was  passed  under  Bush,  and  under  Obama  most  of  the  money  has  been  repaid.  It's  yet  another  silly  tea  bagger  delusion,  this  idea  that  only  Obama  passed  the  stimulus,  and  that  the  stimulus  isn't  the  only  thing  that  saved  us  from  another  great  depression.  Every  expert  says  without  it  we  would  be  living  in  Hoover  tents  right  now.  Anyway,      part  of  the  problem  I  see,  is  that  people  like  yourself  when  I  say  "spending  has  been  cut"  you  are  comparing  spending  now,  to  spending  in  magical  fairy  land,  while  I  on  the  other  hand  am  dealing  with  reality,  and  the  spending  during  the  Bush  years.    3.  Uh,  no.    Every    country  that  has  a  similar  plan,  and  usually  an  even  more  liberal  plan  than  what  was  passed  here,  spends  less  per  capita  on  healthcare.  That  means  they  have  more  money.  That  means  they  are  less  likely  to  have  financial  meltdowns  due  to  healthcare.  Again,  you  do  not  argue  in  reality.  Look  at  any  chart  of  healthcare  spending  and  you  will  see  the  US  spent  nearly  twice  as  much  as  any  country  before  this  was  passed.    4.  Oh  my  god,  are  you  literally  retarded?  I  mean  I  had  my  suspicions  when  I  saw  your  name,  looks  like  a  gay  dating  site  title,  but  that  aside  I  didn't  really  think  you  were  literally  retarded  until  I  saw  your  number  4  point  there.      Bush  was  handed  the  best  economy  in  the  history  of  the  US  due  to  Clinton's  policies.  This  massive  surplus  was  literally  squandered  by  that  monkey  Bush  in  about  3  years.  Due  to  what  you  call  "stimulus"  which  is  really  just  tax  cuts  for  people  who  don't  need  them  and  won't  put  the  money  back  into  the  economy  and  insane  deregulation  that  started  with  Reagan,  we  went  from  the  greatest  US  economy  in  history  to  the  second  worst  in  US  history.    It  is  truly  an  accomplishment  in  itself,  how  one  crappy  president  with  daddy  issues  can  bring  an  entire  economy  to  it's  knees  so  quickly.  Now  we  have  an  intelligent  person  in  office,  and  for  the  first  time  in  about  6  years  each  month  is  showing  less  job  losses  than  the  last,  and  in  some  instances  actual  job  gains,    and  still  you  preach  Bush  era  economic  strategy.  It  is  truly  mind  boggling  how  one  can  be  so  completely  clueless.    Honestly  I'm  bored  of  you  now.    I  will  add  though  to  your  "bigot"  comment.  You  do  realize  that  if  Obama  were  not  black  this  fake  corporate  run  grass  roots  tea  bagger  bs  would  not  happen.  Sure  some  are  just  clueless  idiots  who  live  in  a  Faux  Noise  media  alternate  Universe  and  have  no  idea  how  backwards  their  view  of  what  is  going  on  is,  but  most  are  pissed  because  "real  America"  as  they  put  it,  in  there  view  does  not  include  black  people.  Disliking  people  because  of  their  opinions  is  far  different  than  comparing  a  democratically  elected  president  to  Hitler  and  insisting  he  was  not  born  here  all  because  of  the  color  of  his  skin.    And  I  don't  want  to  hear  the  old  line  "no  that's  not  it  uh,  uh,  it's  his  policies."    Bullshit.  Where  was  the  tea  party  in  the  Clinton  years?  Where  was  the  tea  party  when  Bush  with  the  help  of  that  troll  Cheyenne  destroyed  the  strongest  economy  in  the  world?  Nowhere,  because  Clinton  and  Bush  are  white.  Bigot  indeed.[SEP]I'm  sorry,  your  facts  are  almost  all  completely  made  up,  and  it  is  you,  sir  who  are  living  in  a  land  of  delusions.  I  would  respond  to  you  point  by  point,  but  I  attempted  that  and  it's  clearly  not  worth  the  effort.  Every  word  you  say  is  just  reiterated  talking  points  from  the  democratic  party.  I  don't  think  Bush  was  all  that,  he  did  some  terrible  things.  I  think  the  republicans  do  some  terrible  things.  I  can't  believe  how  blindly  you  are  following  not  just  one  party,  but  one  man.  Turn  off  the  internet,  turn  off  cnn,  start  doing  some  real  research  and  open  your  mind,  you'll  find  that  both  political  parties  and  all  politicians  are  corrupt.[SEP]"turn  off  cnn,  turn  off  the  internet"  and  what?  Turn  on  fox  news  and  the  radio  so  you  can  get  only  biased  information?  The  internet  has  both  view  points  and  by  studying  both  you  can  find  the  truth.	0

Kerry  ended  up  getting  88%  of  the  black  vote,  so  Obama  getting  99%  is  no  surprise.	0

Obama  only  won  because  he  was  African  american  so  most  African  american  vote  him[SEP]Obama  won  because  or  country  was  so  pissed  off  with  Bush  that  a  turtle  could  have  successfully  ran  against  him.  People  didn't  vote    for    Obama,  they  voted    against    Bush,  and  unfortunately,  our  country  was  too  angry  and  stupid  to  pay  attention  to  the  platform  of  our  current  Eunuch-in-Chief.  Everyone  was  "Oh,  cool!  He's  black!  He  went  to  Harvard!  He's  going  to  "change"  things!  There's  "hope"!  Yay!"  Obama  missed  his  calling  as  a  used  car  salesman.	1

And  then  we  can  visit  2004,  when  they  did  it  again.      I  do  agree  insofar  as  most  people  don't  vote  based  on  policies.  They  vote  on  a  number  of  things,  including  likeability,  perceptions,  name  recognition,  gut  reactions,  but  not  on  policy.      I,  on  the  other  hand,  am  not  most  people,  and  I  supported  him  way  back  in  the  primaries  based  on  policy.      I  think  he's  doing  great,  overcoming  a  few  rocky  bumps  at  a  time.	0

He  ran  on  the  slogan  of  honest  government.  All  we've  received  are  more  lies  and  corporatism  under  his  leadership.  He's  doing  so    great    that  tea  party  favorites  such  as  Rand  Paul  are  now  winning  elections.	1

Obama  should  be  re-elected  because  he  has  been  cleaning  up  the  mess  that  Bush  left  for  him  in  the  office.  He  ended  the  war  in  Iraq,  he  is  fixing  problems  with  immigration,  taxes,  and  the  economy.  A  republican  would  mess  up  the  country.	0

You  republicans  are  nothing  more  than  a  brotherhood  of  rich  racists.  You  took  us  from  our  homeland  and  made  billions  of  dollars  off  us  and  now  you  keep  that  money  while  we  starve  in  the  streets.  You  have  kept  us  down  so  long  we  are  killing  each  other  because  we  have  no  money.  It's  time  for  you  to  give  us  your  money  and  Obamas  going  to  do  it.  You  republicans  are  going  to  fall  from  grace  and  us  poor  Africans  are  going  to  take  over  this  country,  then  you  will  know  how  it  feels.	0
