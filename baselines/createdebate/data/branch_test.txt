(o/t,  but  why  can't  I  declare  a  side?)      (Pardon  spelling  errors)      If  you  are  either  undereducated  or  a  non-anglophone,  you  are  forgiving.      he  promotes  progressive  taxation      i.e.  Theft.        Are  you  really  that  unaware  of  the  fact  that  he  was  born  in  Hawaii?      It  was  a  bad  joke.      The  notion  that  he  is  from  another  country  is  at  least  slightly  racist      Nigh  everything  is  perceived  as  racism  in  these  Ã¼ber-sensitive  days.      who  is  more  in  support  of  them  than  he?      Ron  Paul.      taxes  must  reflect  government  spending      No,  the  reverse  is  true.  If  the  government  decides  stupidly  to  waste  a  billion  dollars  they  should  have  that  billion  dollars  in  the  first  place,  rather  than  to  count  on  future  taxation  to  provide  them  with  the  necessary  funds.  Ergo,    government  spending  must  reflect  taxes    (which  ought  never  be  high,  or  else  they'll  have  a  nearly  infinite  amount  of  money  with  which  to  traverse  the  world  in  search  of  demagogues  to  kill).      are  you  arguing  that  he  is  pro  war      Absolutely.  He's  getting  us  involved  unnecessarily  in  Libya,  Uganda,  South  Sudan,  etc.,  etc.      Obama  is  trying  to  get  us  out  of  the  wars  we  got  into  under  bush  II.      All  the  while  getting  us  into  new  ones.      as  far  as  i  know,  these  are  the  way  they  are  because  of  Bush  II.      Which  is  why  I  hate  Bush,  but  they've  been  exacerbated  by  Obama.      Insofar  as  Obama  is  concerned  politically,  it  might  be  a  bad  idea  to  undermine  strong  counter  terrorist  innitiatives.      So  you  are  saying  that  he  is  saving  his  own  ass,  politically  speaking,  rather  than  doing  what  is  right.  Do  you  really  want  a  leader  like  that?	1
look  below  this  post...................................  .........[SEP]I  don't  honestly  see  how  this  man  could  be  re-elected.  For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.  What  you  must  understand  is  that:  The  national  average  when  President  Bush  left  office  the  national  price  for  unleaded  gasoline  was  $1.75  a  gallon,  today  as  I  write  this,  the  Lowest  national  price  for  a  gallon  of  gas  is  $3.80.  When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion  $'s,  today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing,  do  your  math,  President  Bush  created  about  $1  trillion  a  year  in  debt  in  8  years  ,  Obama  has  created  $7  trillion  in  about  4  years,  I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.  The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.  Everyone  keeps  saying  that  "Obama  got  osama",  Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not,  the  Navy  Seal  Team  6  were  the  men  who  killed  osama  in  Bush's  war.  Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.  Obama  wants  to  raise  them  on  the  wealthy,  WHY!?  50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!  why  not  even  give  them  a  tax!  The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share,  they  make  up  for  the  20%  who  do  pay  taxes.  Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.  We  are  all  in  this  together,  stop  alot  of  these  govt  funded  (taxpayer  funded)  programs  and  grow  a  set  and  work  for  your  living  so  your  neighbor  doesn't  have  to!  Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure  as  a  president  6x  more  than  President  Bush.  If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.[SEP]For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.      Then  you  must  also  admit  republican  policy  is  "very  far  from  [ideal]."      The  national  average  when  President  Bush  left  office  the  national  price  for  unleaded  gasoline  was  $1.75  a  gallon,  today  as  I  write  this,  the  Lowest  national  price  for  a  gallon  of  gas  is  $3.80.      Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading    this  .      Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena  .  You  have  no  point.      When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion        $10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.      today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing      But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.    Almost  all  of  our  deficit  can  be  attributed  to  four  main  spending  binges:    1.  Two  unsustainable  useless  wars  started,  passed,  and  continued  by  republicans.  It  took  Obama  to  end  Iraq  and  create  an  endgame  for  Afghanistan  pullout.    2.  Two  unsustainable,  deficit  exploding  tax  cuts  for  the  rich.  All  passed,  initiated,  pushed,  and  signed  by  republicans.    3.  An  unsustainable  social  security  increase.  Take  a  guess  as  to  who  passed  it?    4.  An  unsustainable  Medicare  Part  D  expansion,  the  single  largest  entitlement  increase  in  United  States  history,  and  likely  world  history.  Republicans  sure  are  anti-entitlement  small  government  fiscal  conservatives  aren't  they...    -    But  don't  take  my  word  for  it.  Here  is    Obama  vs.  Bush  New  Spending.      Obama  is  at  a  net  $350  billion  in  non-recession  spending  (projected  out  for  EIGHT  years).  Bush  spent  $4  trillion  in  the  same  time  period.    Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.        I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.      Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus.        The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.        The  effects  of  trickle-down  economics  and  republican  economic  policy  continues  to  be  felt...sad...    And  actually,  the  last  time  it  was  worse  than  this  was  Summer  of  2009.  Since  then,  under  Obama,  the  economy  has  recovered  significantly.      Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not      He  did  much  more  than  that.  And  i'm  damn  glad  he  bought  about  it.  There  was  a  60%  chance  that  he  was  there.  Defense  Secretary  Robert  Gates  (appointed  by  Bush  first  I  might  add)  called  it  one  of  the  gutsiest  decisions  he  has  seen  made  and  he  doubted  other  people  who  have  done  what  Obama  did.          For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.

And  this  was  only  possible  under  Obama's  leadership.    And  don;t  you  dare  give  Bush  ANY  credit  for  this.  The  first  shreds  of  intel  that  came  about  his  whereabout  (that  of  his  courier  actually)  were  found  two  years  before  the  raid.  Obama  was  president  at  that  time.    Maybe  it  was  Bush's  infrastructure?  NO.  Obama  has  killed  22  of  30  top  Al  Qaeda  Heads.  How  many  did  bush  get  in  8  years?  4...    Obama  has  been  BY  FAR  the  best  commander  in  chief  in  modern  american  history.      Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.      Wrong.  Righties  want  taxes  for  working  people,  the  poor  and  middle  class  (who  have  seen  income  increases  of  5%  in  the  past  30  years)  to  be  high  and  cut  taxes  for  the  rich  who  have  seen  income  increases  of  212%  in  the  past  30  years.      Liberals  realize  this  is  incredibly  unfair  and  that  income  inequality  is  vicious,  self-perpetuating  cycle  that  needs  to  stop.        50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!      That  is  a  lie.  Stop  being  spoon  fed  republican  bullshit  lies  and  propaganda.  They  pay  sales  tax.  Property  tax.  Estate  tax.  Social  security/payroll  taxes.  Etc.      The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share      They  do  not.        Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.      When  has  obama  EVER  raised  taxes?    He  cut  taxes  for  small  businesses  16  times.    Extended  the  bush  tax  cut.    Fought  against  republicans  to  extend  patrol  tax  cuts  and  won.    His  jobs  plan  was  over  50%  tax  cuts.    His  stimulus  cut  taxes  for  95%  of  americans.    He  wants  to  cut  corporate  taxes  from  35%  to  28%.    The  corporate  tax  actual  rate  (average  percent  paid...about  12%,  not  the  35%  the  right  whines  about)  is  the  lowest  in  decades  under  Obama.    -    But  no...he  wants  to  raise  taxes.  You  righties  will  just  never  stop  smearing  this  president  with  lies  will  you?  Sickening...      Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure      How?  In  what  area?  He  has  been  a  success.  4  more  years!      6x  more  than  President  Bush.      HA!  That  man  ruined  the  country  and  Obama  begins  to  fix  it,  but  no...he  is  6x  worse.      If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.        Something  you  failed  to  do...[SEP]Of  course  some  moron  has  to  down-vote  this.  I  think  it  is  typical  of  the  maturity  of  the  right.    EDIT:  it  was  ford87  who  down-voted  it.  NO  counter-argument.	1
{Then  you  must  also  admit  republican  policy  is  "very  far  from  [ideal]."}    How  can  that  be?  This  president  has  clearly  proved  he  knows  nothing  of  the  economy  or  foreign  policy  for  that  matter.    {Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading  this.    Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena.  You  have  no  point.}    NO  control?  Are  you  serious?  We  are  sitting  on  200  years  of  oil,  do  you  really  think  that  its  cheaper  to  pay  and  drill  in  countries  over  3000  miles  away?  NO,  drilling  here  at  home  will  cost  LESS,  which  the  president  does  have  control  over  FYI,  if  the  president  can  decide  when  go  to  congress  (which  obama  had  not  for  libya)  to  declare  war  or  raise  taxes  then  he  can  open  oil  reserves  with  no  problem.  I  have  a  fine  point.  YOU  have  no  point.    {$10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.}    True,  I  am  willing  to  accept  when  I  am  wrong.    {But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.

Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.}    Ok  I  will,      1.  Don't  EVER  call  Iraq  a  stupid  war,  if  you  think  going  to  search  and  destroy  osama  bin  laden  in  Bush's  war  was  stupid  well  your  very  undereducated.  We  didn't  just  roll  into  iraq  with  tanks  for  nothing,  9/11  triggered  the  war,  If  you  can  remember  Republicans  and  democrats  stood  on  the  capitol  with  bush  in  and  listened  to  the  star  spangled  banner  in  agreement  that  war  was  absolutley  necessary  and  then  the  democrats  all  ran  away  and  blamed  bush  for  the  war.  Democrats  love  to  pay  thanks  to  our  shitty  president  for  getting  osama  but  what  they  dont  realize  this  is  BUSH'S  WAR  you  all  opposed  and  still  do.    2.  Do  the  poor  create  jobs?  NO.  Does  the  middle  class,  yea  they  contribute  small  business's  but  Steve  Job's,  Bill  Gates,  Alan  Mulally,  etc,  the  rich  create  the  majority  with  jobs  and  what  happens  when  you  tax  them  to  death,  well  they  don't  want  to  lose  all  the  money  of  starting  new  corporations  and  new  enterprises  along  with  the  taxes  and  regulations  of  the  govt  and  they  end  up  moving  their  business's  to  other  countries  where  they  can  make  a  profit.  Did  you  not  read  the  part  where  50%  of  Americans  dont  pay  taxes  and  the  rich  make  up  for  the  20%  that  do?!  and  you  want  to  tax  them  more!?      3.  Aren't  the  democrats  the  ones  who  want  to  spend  money  they  don't  have?    4.  So  theres  1  liberal  thing  a  republican  did,  what  if  we  added  up  all  the  shitty  euro-style  policies  dems  keep  wanting  to  ram  down  the  taxpayers  throats?  Look  what  each  side  spent  it  on,  Bush's  was  the  necessary  war  and  obama's  was  his  failed  stimulus  bill  and  obamacare  that  60%  of  Americans  want  repealed  TODAY?      {Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus}    Ok  first  of  all,  incorrect  liberals  were  for  the  war  in  2001  and  then  they  backed  out  of  it  blaming  it  on  bush  in  ...2001.5.    Why  raise  taxes,  CUT  USELESS  SPENDING,  for  example  funding  the  egyptian  military  when  they  we  just  had  to  pay  5  million  dollars  to  release  American  hostages  from  egypt!?!?  the  should  FUND  THEIR  OWN  DAMN  SELVES!    YES  the  righties  wanted  taxes  for  the  poor,  CAUSE  THEY  DONT  PAY  ANY!  GENIUS!      What  was  there  to  think  about?  was  it  that  hard  to  give  the  go  ahead  to  kill  osama?  If  it  haden't  been  for  this  war  you  were  all  against  we  would  have  never  got  him!!!    I  ask  you,  can  you  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  tell  me  obama  isn't  the  biggest  screw  up  next  to  jimmy  carter?[SEP]I  don't  honestly  see  how  this  man  could  be  re-elected.

Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading    this  .      Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena  .  You  have  no  point.      When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion        $10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.      today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing      But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.    Almost  all  of  our  deficit  can  be  attributed  to  four  main  spending  binges:    1.  Two  unsustainable  useless  wars  started,  passed,  and  continued  by  republicans.  It  took  Obama  to  end  Iraq  and  create  an  endgame  for  Afghanistan  pullout.    2.  Two  unsustainable,  deficit  exploding  tax  cuts  for  the  rich.  All  passed,  initiated,  pushed,  and  signed  by  republicans.    3.  An  unsustainable  social  security  increase.  Take  a  guess  as  to  who  passed  it?    4.  An  unsustainable  Medicare  Part  D  expansion,  the  single  largest  entitlement  increase  in  United  States  history,  and  likely  world  history.  Republicans  sure  are  anti-entitlement  small  government  fiscal  conservatives  aren't  they...    -    But  don't  take  my  word  for  it.  Here  is    Obama  vs.  Bush  New  Spending.      Obama  is  at  a  net  $350  billion  in  non-recession  spending  (projected  out  for  EIGHT  years).  Bush  spent  $4  trillion  in  the  same  time  period.    Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.        I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.      Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus.        The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.        The  effects  of  trickle-down  economics  and  republican  economic  policy  continues  to  be  felt...sad...    And  actually,  the  last  time  it  was  worse  than  this  was  Summer  of  2009.  Since  then,  under  Obama,  the  economy  has  recovered  significantly.      Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not      He  did  much  more  than  that.  And  i'm  damn  glad  he  bought  about  it.  There  was  a  60%  chance  that  he  was  there.  Defense  Secretary  Robert  Gates  (appointed  by  Bush  first  I  might  add)  called  it  one  of  the  gutsiest  decisions  he  has  seen  made  and  he  doubted  other  people  who  have  done  what  Obama  did.          For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.

And  this  was  only  possible  under  Obama's  leadership.    And  don;t  you  dare  give  Bush  ANY  credit  for  this.  The  first  shreds  of  intel  that  came  about  his  whereabout  (that  of  his  courier  actually)  were  found  two  years  before  the  raid.  Obama  was  president  at  that  time.    Maybe  it  was  Bush's  infrastructure?  NO.  Obama  has  killed  22  of  30  top  Al  Qaeda  Heads.  How  many  did  bush  get  in  8  years?  4...    Obama  has  been  BY  FAR  the  best  commander  in  chief  in  modern  american  history.      Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.      Wrong.  Righties  want  taxes  for  working  people,  the  poor  and  middle  class  (who  have  seen  income  increases  of  5%  in  the  past  30  years)  to  be  high  and  cut  taxes  for  the  rich  who  have  seen  income  increases  of  212%  in  the  past  30  years.      Liberals  realize  this  is  incredibly  unfair  and  that  income  inequality  is  vicious,  self-perpetuating  cycle  that  needs  to  stop.        50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!      That  is  a  lie.  Stop  being  spoon  fed  republican  bullshit  lies  and  propaganda.  They  pay  sales  tax.  Property  tax.  Estate  tax.  Social  security/payroll  taxes.  Etc.      The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share      They  do  not.        Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.      When  has  obama  EVER  raised  taxes?    He  cut  taxes  for  small  businesses  16  times.    Extended  the  bush  tax  cut.    Fought  against  republicans  to  extend  patrol  tax  cuts  and  won.    His  jobs  plan  was  over  50%  tax  cuts.    His  stimulus  cut  taxes  for  95%  of  americans.    He  wants  to  cut  corporate  taxes  from  35%  to  28%.    The  corporate  tax  actual  rate  (average  percent  paid...about  12%,  not  the  35%  the  right  whines  about)  is  the  lowest  in  decades  under  Obama.    -    But  no...he  wants  to  raise  taxes.  You  righties  will  just  never  stop  smearing  this  president  with  lies  will  you?  Sickening...      Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure      How?  In  what  area?  He  has  been  a  success.  4  more  years!      6x  more  than  President  Bush.      HA!  That  man  ruined  the  country  and  Obama  begins  to  fix  it,  but  no...he  is  6x  worse.      If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.        Something  you  failed  to  do...	1
{Then  you  must  also  admit  republican  policy  is  "very  far  from  [ideal]."}    How  can  that  be?  This  president  has  clearly  proved  he  knows  nothing  of  the  economy  or  foreign  policy  for  that  matter.    {Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading  this.    Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena.  You  have  no  point.}    NO  control?  Are  you  serious?  We  are  sitting  on  200  years  of  oil,  do  you  really  think  that  its  cheaper  to  pay  and  drill  in  countries  over  3000  miles  away?  NO,  drilling  here  at  home  will  cost  LESS,  which  the  president  does  have  control  over  FYI,  if  the  president  can  decide  when  go  to  congress  (which  obama  had  not  for  libya)  to  declare  war  or  raise  taxes  then  he  can  open  oil  reserves  with  no  problem.  I  have  a  fine  point.  YOU  have  no  point.    {$10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.}    True,  I  am  willing  to  accept  when  I  am  wrong.    {But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.

Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.}    Ok  I  will,      1.  Don't  EVER  call  Iraq  a  stupid  war,  if  you  think  going  to  search  and  destroy  osama  bin  laden  in  Bush's  war  was  stupid  well  your  very  undereducated.  We  didn't  just  roll  into  iraq  with  tanks  for  nothing,  9/11  triggered  the  war,  If  you  can  remember  Republicans  and  democrats  stood  on  the  capitol  with  bush  in  and  listened  to  the  star  spangled  banner  in  agreement  that  war  was  absolutley  necessary  and  then  the  democrats  all  ran  away  and  blamed  bush  for  the  war.  Democrats  love  to  pay  thanks  to  our  shitty  president  for  getting  osama  but  what  they  dont  realize  this  is  BUSH'S  WAR  you  all  opposed  and  still  do.    2.  Do  the  poor  create  jobs?  NO.  Does  the  middle  class,  yea  they  contribute  small  business's  but  Steve  Job's,  Bill  Gates,  Alan  Mulally,  etc,  the  rich  create  the  majority  with  jobs  and  what  happens  when  you  tax  them  to  death,  well  they  don't  want  to  lose  all  the  money  of  starting  new  corporations  and  new  enterprises  along  with  the  taxes  and  regulations  of  the  govt  and  they  end  up  moving  their  business's  to  other  countries  where  they  can  make  a  profit.  Did  you  not  read  the  part  where  50%  of  Americans  dont  pay  taxes  and  the  rich  make  up  for  the  20%  that  do?!  and  you  want  to  tax  them  more!?      3.  Aren't  the  democrats  the  ones  who  want  to  spend  money  they  don't  have?    4.  So  theres  1  liberal  thing  a  republican  did,  what  if  we  added  up  all  the  shitty  euro-style  policies  dems  keep  wanting  to  ram  down  the  taxpayers  throats?  Look  what  each  side  spent  it  on,  Bush's  was  the  necessary  war  and  obama's  was  his  failed  stimulus  bill  and  obamacare  that  60%  of  Americans  want  repealed  TODAY?      {Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus}    Ok  first  of  all,  incorrect  liberals  were  for  the  war  in  2001  and  then  they  backed  out  of  it  blaming  it  on  bush  in  ...2001.5.    Why  raise  taxes,  CUT  USELESS  SPENDING,  for  example  funding  the  egyptian  military  when  they  we  just  had  to  pay  5  million  dollars  to  release  American  hostages  from  egypt!?!?  the  should  FUND  THEIR  OWN  DAMN  SELVES!    YES  the  righties  wanted  taxes  for  the  poor,  CAUSE  THEY  DONT  PAY  ANY!  GENIUS!      What  was  there  to  think  about?  was  it  that  hard  to  give  the  go  ahead  to  kill  osama?  If  it  haden't  been  for  this  war  you  were  all  against  we  would  have  never  got  him!!!    I  ask  you,  can  you  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  tell  me  obama  isn't  the  biggest  screw  up  next  to  jimmy  carter?[SEP]How  can  that  be?  This  president  has  clearly  proved  he  knows  nothing  of  the  economy  or  foreign  policy  for  that  matter.      What  are  you  talking  about?!  You  said  Bush  sucked.  Reublicans  completely  supported  Bush's  policy.  So  you  must  also  admit  that  republicans  are  lying,  two-faced,  corrupt,  hypocritical,  freedom-hating,  war-mogering,  backwards-minded,  fact-ignoring  piece  of  shits.      I  would  suggest  reading  this.      Reading  what?!  I  gave  the  facts.  You  ignored  them  like  a  typical  right-wing  nutcase.      I  am  willing  to  accept  when  I  am  wrong.      Bullshit.      Don't  EVER  call  Iraq  a  stupid  war      The  Iraq  war  was  stupid.      if  you  think  going  to  search  and  destroy  osama  bin  laden  in  Bush's  war  was  stupid  well  your  very  undereducated.      1.  If  you  are  going  to  call  someone  "uneducated,"  don't  make  grammatical  mistakes  in  your  insult.    2.  I  wasn't  aware  of  the  fact  that  Osama  was  found  in  Iraq...forgive  me  basing  my  conclusions  on  facts  and  logic,  not  bullshit  like  you.      If  you  can  remember  Republicans  and  democrats  stood  on  the  capitol  with  bush  in  and  listened  to  the  star  spangled  banner  in  agreement  that  war  was  absolutely  necessary      Where  the  fuck  do  you  get  your  facts?      6  House  republicans  voted  against  the  war  vote.    126  Democrats  voted  against  the  vote.      Do  the  poor  create  jobs?  NO.      You  are  truly  an  idiot  if  you  believe  trickle-down  economics  has  worked.  Where  the  fuck  are  the  jobs  if  it  worked?!  It's  not  like  we  just  had  an  unprecedented  economic  crisis.        Aren't  the  democrats  the  ones  who  want  to  spend  money  they  don't  have?      Nope.  That  was  100%  republican  policy,  supported  by  republicans.        So  theres  1  liberal  thing  a  republican  did      How  can  it  be  liberal  if  it  was  proposed  and  passed  by  a  republican  and  supported  by  republicans?        incorrect  liberals  were  for  the  war  in  2001      Check  the  vote  again.      Why  raise  taxes,  CUT  USELESS  SPENDING,  for  example  funding  the  egyptian  military  when  they  we  just  had  to  pay  5  million  dollars  to  release  American  hostages  from  egypt!?!?  the  should  FUND  THEIR  OWN  DAMN  SELVES!    YES  the  righties  wanted  taxes  for  the  poor,  CAUSE  THEY  DONT  PAY  ANY!  GENIUS!          Nowhere  in  your  incoherent  rambling  did  you  even  come  close  to  forming  a  rational  argument.      What  was  there  to  think  about?  was  it  that  hard  to  give  the  go  ahead  to  kill  osama?  If  it  haden't  been  for  this  war  you  were  all  against  we  would  have  never  got  him!!!      WTF?!?!  There  was  only  a  60%  chance  that  he  was  there.  Do  you  have  any  idea  what  the  ramification  would  have  been  if  he  wasn't  there?  Even  Bush-appointed  gates  called  it  one  of  the  gutsiest  decisions  he  had  seen  made.    And  what  are  you  smoking?!  He  was  found  in  PAKISTAN!      I  ask  you,  can  you  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  tell  me  obama  isn't  the  biggest  screw  up  next  to  jimmy  carter?      Obama  is  one  of  the  greatest  presidents  in  modern  times.  Happy?[SEP]I  don't  honestly  see  how  this  man  could  be  re-elected.  For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.  What  you  must  understand  is  that:  The  national  average  when  President  Bush  left  office  the  national  price  for  unleaded  gasoline  was  $1.75  a  gallon,  today  as  I  write  this,  the  Lowest  national  price  for  a  gallon  of  gas  is  $3.80.  When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion  $'s,  today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing,  do  your  math,  President  Bush  created  about  $1  trillion  a  year  in  debt  in  8  years  ,  Obama  has  created  $7  trillion  in  about  4  years,  I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.  The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.  Everyone  keeps  saying  that  "Obama  got  osama",  Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not,  the  Navy  Seal  Team  6  were  the  men  who  killed  osama  in  Bush's  war.  Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.  Obama  wants  to  raise  them  on  the  wealthy,  WHY!?  50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!  why  not  even  give  them  a  tax!  The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share,  they  make  up  for  the  20%  who  do  pay  taxes.  Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.  We  are  all  in  this  together,  stop  alot  of  these  govt  funded  (taxpayer  funded)  programs  and  grow  a  set  and  work  for  your  living  so  your  neighbor  doesn't  have  to!  Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure  as  a  president  6x  more  than  President  Bush.  If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.[SEP]For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.

That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.    Almost  all  of  our  deficit  can  be  attributed  to  four  main  spending  binges:    1.  Two  unsustainable  useless  wars  started,  passed,  and  continued  by  republicans.

All  passed,  initiated,  pushed,  and  signed  by  republicans.    3.  An  unsustainable  social  security  increase.  Take  a  guess  as  to  who  passed  it?    4.  An  unsustainable  Medicare  Part  D  expansion,  the  single  largest  entitlement  increase  in  United  States  history,  and  likely  world  history.  Republicans  sure  are  anti-entitlement  small  government  fiscal  conservatives  aren't  they...    -    But  don't  take  my  word  for  it.  Here  is    Obama  vs.  Bush  New  Spending.      Obama  is  at  a  net  $350  billion  in  non-recession  spending  (projected  out  for  EIGHT  years).  Bush  spent  $4  trillion  in  the  same  time  period.    Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.        I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.      Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus.        The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.        The  effects  of  trickle-down  economics  and  republican  economic  policy  continues  to  be  felt...sad...    And  actually,  the  last  time  it  was  worse  than  this  was  Summer  of  2009.  Since  then,  under  Obama,  the  economy  has  recovered  significantly.      Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not      He  did  much  more  than  that.  And  i'm  damn  glad  he  bought  about  it.  There  was  a  60%  chance  that  he  was  there.  Defense  Secretary  Robert  Gates  (appointed  by  Bush  first  I  might  add)  called  it  one  of  the  gutsiest  decisions  he  has  seen  made  and  he  doubted  other  people  who  have  done  what  Obama  did.          For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.      Then  you  must  also  admit  republican  policy  is  "very  far  from  [ideal]."      The  national  average  when  President  Bush  left  office  the  national  price  for  unleaded  gasoline  was  $1.75  a  gallon,  today  as  I  write  this,  the  Lowest  national  price  for  a  gallon  of  gas  is  $3.80.      Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading    this  .      Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena  .  You  have  no  point.      When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion        $10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.      today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing      But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.

And  this  was  only  possible  under  Obama's  leadership.    And  don;t  you  dare  give  Bush  ANY  credit  for  this.  The  first  shreds  of  intel  that  came  about  his  whereabout  (that  of  his  courier  actually)  were  found  two  years  before  the  raid.  Obama  was  president  at  that  time.    Maybe  it  was  Bush's  infrastructure?  NO.  Obama  has  killed  22  of  30  top  Al  Qaeda  Heads.  How  many  did  bush  get  in  8  years?  4...    Obama  has  been  BY  FAR  the  best  commander  in  chief  in  modern  american  history.      Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.      Wrong.  Righties  want  taxes  for  working  people,  the  poor  and  middle  class  (who  have  seen  income  increases  of  5%  in  the  past  30  years)  to  be  high  and  cut  taxes  for  the  rich  who  have  seen  income  increases  of  212%  in  the  past  30  years.      Liberals  realize  this  is  incredibly  unfair  and  that  income  inequality  is  vicious,  self-perpetuating  cycle  that  needs  to  stop.        50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!      That  is  a  lie.  Stop  being  spoon  fed  republican  bullshit  lies  and  propaganda.  They  pay  sales  tax.  Property  tax.  Estate  tax.  Social  security/payroll  taxes.  Etc.      The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share      They  do  not.        Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.      When  has  obama  EVER  raised  taxes?    He  cut  taxes  for  small  businesses  16  times.    Extended  the  bush  tax  cut.    Fought  against  republicans  to  extend  patrol  tax  cuts  and  won.    His  jobs  plan  was  over  50%  tax  cuts.    His  stimulus  cut  taxes  for  95%  of  americans.    He  wants  to  cut  corporate  taxes  from  35%  to  28%.    The  corporate  tax  actual  rate  (average  percent  paid...about  12%,  not  the  35%  the  right  whines  about)  is  the  lowest  in  decades  under  Obama.    -    But  no...he  wants  to  raise  taxes.  You  righties  will  just  never  stop  smearing  this  president  with  lies  will  you?  Sickening...      Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure      How?  In  what  area?  He  has  been  a  success.  4  more  years!      6x  more  than  President  Bush.      HA!  That  man  ruined  the  country  and  Obama  begins  to  fix  it,  but  no...he  is  6x  worse.      If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.        Something  you  failed  to  do...	0

Ergo,    government  spending  must  reflect  taxes    (which  ought  never  be  high,  or  else  they'll  have  a  nearly  infinite  amount  of  money  with  which  to  traverse  the  world  in  search  of  demagogues  to  kill).      are  you  arguing  that  he  is  pro  war      Absolutely.

The  notion  that  he  is  from  another  country  is  at  least  slightly  racist      Nigh  everything  is  perceived  as  racism  in  these  Ã¼ber-sensitive  days.      who  is  more  in  support  of  them  than  he?      Ron  Paul.      taxes  must  reflect  government  spending      No,  the  reverse  is  true.  If  the  government  decides  stupidly  to  waste  a  billion  dollars  they  should  have  that  billion  dollars  in  the  first  place,  rather  than  to  count  on  future  taxation  to  provide  them  with  the  necessary  funds.  Ergo,    government  spending  must  reflect  taxes    (which  ought  never  be  high,  or  else  they'll  have  a  nearly  infinite  amount  of  money  with  which  to  traverse  the  world  in  search  of  demagogues  to  kill).      are  you  arguing  that  he  is  pro  war      Absolutely.  He's  getting  us  involved  unnecessarily  in  Libya,  Uganda,  South  Sudan,  etc.,  etc.      Obama  is  trying  to  get  us  out  of  the  wars  we  got  into  under  bush  II.      All  the  while  getting  us  into  new  ones.      as  far  as  i  know,  these  are  the  way  they  are  because  of  Bush  II.      Which  is  why  I  hate  Bush,  but  they've  been  exacerbated  by  Obama.      Insofar  as  Obama  is  concerned  politically,  it  might  be  a  bad  idea  to  undermine  strong  counter  terrorist  innitiatives.      So  you  are  saying  that  he  is  saving  his  own  ass,  politically  speaking,  rather  than  doing  what  is  right.  Do  you  really  want  a  leader  like  that?[SEP]Progressive  taxation  is  not  theft,  if  you  think  of  it  in  terms  of  %  of  GDP  and  also  in  terms  of  maximal  aggregate  demand,  as  well  as  understanding  that  wealth  accumulation  is  made  possible  by  the  whole  system  operating  collectively  -&gt;  the  wealthy  pay  far  less  than  they  ought  to,  donât  contribute  to  economic  prosperity  as  much  as  the  middle  class  does,  and  all  the  while  are  able  to  enjoy  a  much  higher  standard  and  quality  of  living.  Progressive  taxation  is  necessary  for  justice  and  equity,  not  to  mention  that  it  reduces  crime  by  ameliorating  the  stratification  of  wealth.  Ameliorating  the  stratification  of  wealth  reduces  desperation  and  thus  crime.      "uber-sensitive"  -  using  this  phrase  as  a  criticism  of  something  that  conflicts  with  your  idea  of  propriety  doesnât  invalidate  the  truth  that  what  you  said  is  racist.  You  appear  to  be  engaging  in  cognitive  dissonance.  You  should  learn  more  about  modern  racism  because  what  you  said  was  well  within  the  scope  of  this  definition    Government  spending  cant  reflect  taxes  insofar  as  we  demand  something  to  be  provided  for  by  our  government      Civilian  Need  +  Demand  -&gt;  Govt.  Spending  =  Cost  which  is  paid  for  by  taxes    I  agree  that  it  should  not  be  in  excess,  that  it  should  be  as  small  as  is  prudent.    I  donât  know  too  much  about  the  likelihood  of  those  military  conflicts,  so  you  could  be  right  about  that.      I  donât  want  a  purely  utilitarian  president,  but  I  also  donât  want  a  dumb  president  that  will  do  something  out  of  idealism  which  may  have  a  bigger  costs  in  terms  of  the  overall  consequences.[SEP]Progressive  taxation  is  not  theft      Any  form  of  taxation  is  theft.      donât  contribute  to  economic  prosperity  as  much  as  the  middle  class  does      Who  the  hell  have  you  been  reading?  Keynes?  Without  the  wealthy  there  would  be  no  middle  class  jobs.      and  all  the  while  are  able  to  enjoy  a  much  higher  standard  and  quality  of  living.      If  they've  never  contributed  then  how  did  they  manage  to  make  money  in  a  market  economy  in  which  he  who  serves  best  earns  best  (oversimplification,  I'll  agree,  but  nevertheless  true  quite  often)?        "uber-sensitive"      That's  not  what  I  wrote.      using  this  phrase  as  a  criticism  of  something  that  conflicts  with  your  idea  of  propriety  doesnât  invalidate  the  truth  that  what  you  said  is  racist.      Truth  is  subjective.      You  appear  to  be  engaging  in  cognitive  dissonance.      Not  in  the  least.      You  should  learn  more  about  modern  racism  because  what  you  said  was  well  within  the  scope  of  this  definition      Whose  definition?  That  of  the  far-left  who  think  that  it  is  racist  not  to  put  the  nigger  ahead  of  the  cracker  (to  put  it  most  bluntly)?  As  a  philologist  I  take  very  strong  objection  to  the  politicization  of  words.      Government  spending  cant  reflect  taxes  insofar  as  we  demand  something  to  be  provided  for  by  our  government      Who  is  this  'we'  about  whom  you  speak?      I  agree  that  it  should  not  be  in  excess,  that  it  should  be  as  small  as  is  prudent      Yet  that  which  can  be  thought  of  as  prudent  is  open  to  vastly  different  opinion.      but  I  also  donât  want  a  dumb  president  that  will  do  something  out  of  idealism  which  may  have  a  bigger  costs  in  terms  of  the  overall  consequences.      My  sentiments  exactly,  but  about  Obama.[SEP]Taxation  isnât  theft,  because  like  it  or  not  you  are  part  of  a  group  of  people  and  insofar  as  that  group  needs  defense  and  the  rule  of  law  at  a  bare  minimum,  you  have  an  obligation  to  them.  A  lot  of  the  taxation  is  theft  mentality  is  predicated  on  the  notion  that  we  (humans)  are  not  primarily  social  beings.  Most  of  what  you  do  in  the  world  is  social  activity  -  buying  goods  and  services,  owning  property,  etc...  all  things  are  allowed  for  and  provided  by  a  society  of  people,  participation  is  a  privilege  and  you  tacitly  comply  with  and  assent  to  taxation  merely  by  participating    The  'We'  is  the  nation  as  a  whole,  the  demand  of  the  masses  as  expressed  through  voting  and  engaging  in  political  discourse.      i  definitely  agree  that  prudent  is  open  to  opinion,  this  is  where  the  'We'  comes  in,  the  'we'  becomes  the  expression  of  the  collective  opinon    You  have  obviously  been  smoking  the  supply  side  theory  insofar  as  you  think  that  the  middle  class  is  allowed  for  by  the  wealthy.  Tax  policy  and  education  policy  is  what  allows  for  the  creation  of  a  middle  class  and  jobs  are  created  by  the  market.  It  is  true  that  if  the  wealthy  have  all  the  money  that  jobs  are  created  by  them  because  they  are  the  only  ones  who  could  invest,  however,  if  they  donât  have  all  the  money,  jobs  are  created  by  where  money  is  invested.  Middle  class  people  can  invest  just  as  much  as  the  wealthy,  and  do  when  given  the  opportunity  to  when  tax  policy  is  not  skewed  in  favor  of  the  wealthy.  Just  because  a  lot  of  money  is  in  the  hands  of  the  wealthy,  doesnât  mean  that  this  is  the  fundamental  nature  of  job  creation,  it  is  only  the  nature  of  job  creation  in  an  extremely  stratified  society.  Extreme  stratification  also  creates  instability  in  the  market  because  investment  is  based  on  the  whim  of  a  small  number  of  individuals  who  have  often,  in  the  past,  jumped  ship  and  played  with  the  markets  toward  their  own  personal  gain  (not  that  personal  gain  is  a  problem,  it  is  only  a  problem  when  it  is  done  by  manipulation  and  with  the  known  consequence  of  huge  costs  to  other  people.)  This  is  why  there  are  anti-trust  laws  and  laws  that  prevent  monopolies.      The  he  who  serves  best  earns  best  notion  is  valid  to  a  point,  but  national  income  is  not  a  reflection  of  this,  income  and  wealth  is  a  reflection  of  the  degree  to  which  a  few  people  control  the  means  of  production  and  maintain  that  order  through  a  rationalised  stratification.  I  am  not  against  stratification,  I  just  think  that  there  needs  to  be  an  ameliorative  taxation  policy  to  prevent  the  various  forms  of  desperation  that  are  fundamental  to  capitalist  systems.      You  totally  did  write  uber-sensitive    Some  truth  is  subjective,  some  truth  is  objective,  like  this  -  it  is  objectively  true  that  you  are  reading  this  right  now.  I  would  argue  that  truth  that  which  is  subjective  is  only  opinion.  subjectivity  is  dependent  on  perception,  objectivity  is  about  things  that  are  true  independent  of  perception  even  if  they  require  a  perceiver.  Truth  does  exist  independent  of  belief  about  what  is  true.    Afirmative  action  is  not  about  putting  african  americans  ahead  of  caucasion  ,  it  is  about  social  justice,  it  is  not  fundamentally  left,  and  is  distinct  from  the  notion  of  modern  racism  even  though  it  relates  to  racial  issues.  modern  racism  is  when  you  -  believe  racism  is  a  thing  of  the  past,  -  make  associations  about  people  based  on  their  ethnicity  or  skin  color  that  are  not  necessary  links.  it  is  racist  because  you  are  making  judgements  and  acusations  about  people  according  to  their  skin  color  or  ethnicity,  this  includes  names  and  religions  that  are  a  persons  cultuaral  heritage.	0

Wow.  Did  you  even  watch  the  clip?!?!  He  was  talking  about  trifle-down  economics,  and  I  agree  with  him  110%.  It  doesn't  work.  It  has  never  worked.  And  also  CNS  News?

Here's  is  his  economic  record:    -      Jobs      The  month  he  took  office,  we  lost  750,000  jobs.  We  have  now  had  6  consecutive  months  of  job  growth  greater  than  100,000.

There  were  convenient  breaks  in  the  quotes  so  they  could  be  patched  together  in  a  way  he  didn't  intend  them  to  be  said.

Jobs  are  not  created  by  the  wealthy,  but  by  the  entire  market.[SEP]Totally,  People  need  to  start  thinking  in  terms  of  -  maximal  aggrigate  demand.  I  feel  like  most  right  wing  economic  ideas  do  not  promote  maximal  aggregate  demand  and  thus  I  question  the  right  wing  economic  ideas  with  respect  to  their  intelligence  and  justifiability  with  respect  to  economic  evidence  and  modern  economic  theory.      progressive  taxation  inspires  greater  consumption  from  the  group  that  consumes  the  greatest  -  The  Middle  Class.  It  is  the  best  way  to  accelerate  economic  activity.  As  far  as  i  am  aware,  Supply  side  economics  (i.e.  trickle  down  economics  -  right  wing  economics)  is  contrary  to  maximal  aggrigate  demand  because  it  doesnt  promote  consumption.      Aggregate  Demand  is  the  combination  of  Consumptions,  Investment,  Govt.  Spending,  and  Net  Trade  activity.  As  far  as  i  know,  the  wealthy  invest  and  consume  at  a  relatively  static  level  as  a  group.  The  middle  class  invest  and  consume  relative  to  their  ability.  Progressive  taxation  increases  this  ability  for  the  middle  class  and  thus,  in  order  to  maximize  aggregate  demand  we  need  to  policies  that  promote  the  middle  class  (typically  left  wing,  socialistic  policies).      To  me  it  comes  down  to  patriotism,  a  patriot  wants  the  whole  country  to  do  well.  I  question  the  patriotism  of  the  right  wing  because  their  policies  tend  to  undermine  total  economic  wellbeing  which  is  fundamental  to  maximal  economic  prosperity[SEP]Why?

Well,  he's  the  best  chioce  for  the  rest  of  the  world,  that's  for  dam  sure.[SEP]Risks  need  to  be  taken  in  these  economically  turbulent  times.      To  put  it  better,  I  do  not  agree  with  his  economic  views,  I  think  they  would  be  bad  for  the  global  economy.      Simply?  How  do  you  know  that?  It  seems  likley  (to  me  at  least)  he'd  be  more  a  unifying  force,  I'd  say  there  are  almost  as  many  Democrats  willing  to  vote  for  him  as  there  are  republicans.      But  people  aren't  simply  defined  as  Republicans  or  Democrats.  His  progressive  policies  would  anger  a  large  number  of  the  huge  conservative  population  in  the  US.  I  would  be  surprised  if  there  was  no  a  reaction  should  all  of  his  policies  be  passed.      Ya,  cause  nobody  wants  change.      Change  for  the  sake  of  change  though,  is  that  always  a  good  thing?  And  again,  conservatives,  they  don't.      There's  actually  nothing  new  about  most  of  his  policies.      There's  something  new  with  his  ideas  being  given  the  voice  that  he  gives  them,  such  strong  Libertarian  views  in  mass  media,  taken  seriously.  I  didn't  say  he  was  new  in  himself,  simply  what  he's  doing  it  new.      Well,  he's  the  best  chioce  for  the  rest  of  the  world,  that's  for  dam  sure.      I'd  agree  to  that.  Obama's  doing  well  enough,  I  think,  but  any  of  the  other  Republicans  would  be  very  bad  for  the  international  community  as  a  whole.  Paul,  I  think,  would  be  good.	0
Socialism  is  essentially  the  principle  of  amelioration  applied  to  social  and  political  discourse.  This  doesnt  mean  pure  equitability  which  characterizes  communism,  rather,  it  means  to  promote  a  balance  between  the  tendency  for  stratafication  and  the  ideal  of  providing  for  base  level  provisions  -  food,  shelter,  clothing,  health.      Evidence  suggests  that  socialism  tends  to  reduce  crime.  Socialist  policies  promote  education  as  well,  which  can  only  serve  to  benefit  our  economic  situation  insofar  as  our  nation  has  become  a  service-based  economy,  and  our  remaining  industries  are  both  capital  intensive  and  require  at  least  some  post  secondary  degrees  (High  tech  industries).      Insofar  as  this  is  true,  Obama,  who  has  an  idiologically  left  (socialistic)  alignment,  is  the  best  option.  His  efficacy  at  promoting  socialist  policies  is  limited  by  the  right  aligned  political  majority  in  congress,  however,  if  he  were  able  to  promote  his  ideas  our  country  would  benefit  over  the  long  run  more  than  it  would  otherwise.	0
Why  is  this  argument  so  based  on  what  a  republican  did  8  years  ago  or  what  a  democrat  did  12  years  ago.  Yes,  we  can  look  which  party  is  to  blame  for  which  problem  but  it  doesn't  help  much  when  looking  forward.  You  can't  simply  state  that  whoever  was  in  office  at  the  time  an  issue  arose  that  it  was  their  fault.  Things  take  time  to  pan  out.	0
i  would  vote  no  but,  anyways.,  look  obama  might  not  have  screwed  anything  up  but.  like  all  american  presidents  he  did  noting  but  screwed  the  country  more.  china  could  kill  the  united  states  because  no  president  focus  on  there  metal  problem  of  90  trill  in  debt	0

I  think  this  is  be  answered  in  the  simplest  of  fashions.  He  will  be  re-elected  but  it  is  the  reason  for  that  bothers  me.  It  is  not  about  what  he  has  done  or  not  done.  In  2012,  it  is  about  how  the  Republican  Party  has  acted  so  poorly  over  the  last  year  most  recently  and  continually  with  the  budget  then  add  in  the  total  lack  of  viable  Republican  candidates.  Ron  Paul  is  about  the  only  one  who  has  enough  to  say  that  it  is  worth  listening  to.  (whether  you  agree  or  not).  I  am  a  liberal  Republican  and  looking  at  this  election,  the  Republican  party  might  as  well  place  a  loaded  trash  bag  in  a  suit  and  call  it  a  candidate.  Sad  but  true.	0

Obama  is  simply  the  only  valid  choice  between  him  and  the  four  other  Republican  candidates.  The  current  front  runner  for  the  Republican  party  (Romney)  has  changed  his  mind  so  many  time  on  such  an  extreme  level,  that  he  cannot  be  trusted.  Even  Ron  Paul  is  completely  crazy.  He  wants  to  get  rid  of  civil  rights  laws  that  make  segregation  illegal.  He  is  entirely  for  states  rights  to  control  just  about  everything.  He  wants  to  get  rid  of  Federal  Highways.  Newt  Gingrich  is  a  complete  ass  who  seems  to  like  corporations  than  the  middle  class.  Santorum  is  a  Homophobic  racist  who  pretended  that  he  didn't  say  that  the  US  should  support  black  people,  despite  video  evidence  of  him  saying  it.  Obama  is  the  only  candidate  that  can  be  trusted  to  not  screw  the  country  over.  I  agree  that  his  economic  reform  plan  was  not  very  affective,  but  until  I  hear  the  other  four  candidates  suggest  something  that  could  even  remotely  work  better  than  Obama,  I'm  going  to  have  to  stick  with  him.	0
yes,  Obama  should  be  re  -elected.  He  has  really  tried  to  get  the  economy  back  on  it's  feet  and  really  seems  to  care  about  the  middle  class,  bringing  jobs  back  to  America,  and  ending  the  war.      Obama  gave  a  speech  this  past  summer  on  the  war  and  he  mentioned  that  the  war  has  been  costing  our  country  about  $10  billion  per  year  and  I  was  floored  by  that  because  I  think  that  the  money  can  be  used  towards  better  things  such  as  helping  students  pay  off  loans,  providing  jobs  for  Americans,  putting  food  in  people's  mouths,  helping  people  get  their  homes  back,  etc.        I  also  can't  believe  that  although  so  many  people  voted  Obama  into  office,  that  so  many  people  such  as  in  the  house  of  representatives  and/or  senate  have  vetoed  his  economic  proposals  which  were  clearly  created  to  help  "the  little  guys"  like  me  -poor  college  educated  people.  That  just  don't  make  sense  to  me,  it  looks  like  they're  trying  to  prove  a  negative  point  such  as  a  black  guy  couldn't  cut  it  as  president.  While  I'm  not  totally  racist  there  are  some  people  in  the  house  of  representatives,  senate,  and/or  running  for  election.  And  not  everyone  who  is  racist  is  a  member  of  the  KKK,  nazi,  or  skinhead  -  some  of  them  may  smile  at  your  face  and  speak  nice  to  your  face  but  kick  you  in  the  teeth  personally  or  professionally  behind  your  back.  And  these  people  running  for  president,  all  I  hear  is  "blah,  blah,  blah"  but  no  one  cares  about  the  "real  issues"  facing  American  such  as:  health  care  for  low  income  people,  jobs  coming  back  to  America,  creating  jobs  for  teachers,  bringing  discipline  back  in  the  classrooms,  etc.	0

That  is  PER  MONTH!      helping  students  pay  off  loans      Obama's  already  got  that  covered.  He  passed  student  loan  reform  and  is  urging  congress  to  extend  low  interest  rates  for  student  loans.      providing  jobs  for  Americans      We  are  so  close  to  being  were  we  were  when  he  took  office.  The  past  year  has  been  incredible  for  the  economy.    Please  vote  for  him  even  if  I  can't!  Our  economy  won't  survive  another  republican  "Trickle-down  economics"  president.	1
Right  now,  this  is  a  major  global  world-  we're  connected  in  ways  that  were  thought  nearly  impossible  just  fifty  years  ago!  The  boundaries  between  countries  are  fading,  so  what  we  need  now  is  a  great  FOREIGN  POLICY  president  and  if  Obama  is  good  with  one  thing,  it's  with  keeping  debates,  being  respectful,  and  connecting  with  global  leaders.  The  U.S.  has  never  been  in  a  more  critical  global  part  in  our  lives-  we  import  62%  percent  of  our  oil!-  and  we  need  the  good  will  of  other  countries,  especially  Asian  superpowers  whether  we  like  it  or  not.  Obama  already  proved  himself  efficient  in  this  case:  it  took  him  just  two  weeks  to  convince  Egyptian  dictator  Hasni  Mubarak  to  step  out  of  office.  It  took  a  year  for  Clinton  to  do  the  same  with  another  unstable  leader!    We  already  know  he's  a  good  foreign  policy  leader;  I  think  that  in  the  next  four  years  he'll  have  experience  enough  to  be  a  truly  great  one...  like  President  Truman.  Besides  the  president  can't  really  control  the  economy  all  that  much  (too  complicated  to  explain  now)  so  shouldn't  we  elect  our  leaders  based  on  what  they  can  do?	0
A  definite  'yes'.  It  seems  a  lot  of  people  have  'conveniently'  forgotten  that  the  Bush  administration  pretty  much  sucked  the  wind  out  of  our  nation  (and  world),  with  its  'shoot  from  the  hip'  policies.  TARP  money  was  first  brought  up  by  him,  and  in  case  your  memory  is  not  good,  most  of  the  money  Bush  received  could  not  even  be  traced.  No  one  seemed  to  know  where  it  went!  His  policies  began  the  process  of  deteriotaton  that  Obama  inherited.  By  the  time  Obama  took  office,  the  deed  was  done,  and  he  was  faced  with  something  akin  to  being  given  command  of  the  'Titantic'.  Due  to  his  diligence  and  vision,  we  are  now  beginning  to  'see  the  light',  in  spite  of  the  non-cooperative  Congress  he  is  working  with.  If  you  know  anything  about  American  politics,  you  realize,  the  President's  power  are  limited,  and  dependent  upon  Congress.  In  other  words,  even  if  his  policies  were  'perfect',  if  Congress  decided  not  to  support  them,  they  would  go  no  where.    Perhaps  the  greatest  argument'  can  be  found  not  just  in  the  political  arena,  but  in  the  totality  of  the  man.  Agree  or  disagree  with  his  actions,  you  have  to  give  credit  to  the  fact  that  he  is  a  man  who  keeps  his  promises,  and  maintains  integrity  in  both  his  personal  and  professional  life  That  type  of  man  is  more  likely  to  succeed  for  it  takes  integrity  and  committment  to  accomplsh  worthy  goals.  Everyone  will  never  be  pleased  'all  the  time',  but  if  the  individual  leading  is  at  least  one  of  good  moral  fibre,  and  is  reasonably  intelligent,  he  will  do  the  right  thing  which  will  serve  everyone.  Obama  is  such  a  man.	0

His  ideas  start  of  OK,  but  then  they  go  way  to  far.  He  wants  to  pull  out  our  foreign  troops.  Sounds  good.  All  of  our  foreign  troops.  Well  that  seems  a  bit  much  but  OK.        They  don't  belong  in  other  countries.  That's  why  we  call  them    other    countries,  they  aren't  our  own,  therefore  we  don't  belong  there  in  a  militaristic  capacity.      And  he  wants  the  US  to  become  completely  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  world      It's  not  quite  like  that.  He's  for  international  business,  but  doesn't  think  that  the  government  has  any  business  in  interfering  with  other  governments  affairs.        not  only  back  out  of  the  UN      We  ought  never  have  become  involved  in  such  an  organization;  it  relieves  us  of  some  of  our  sovereignty,  however  slight,  and  that  is  never  good.      but  also  evict  the  UN  from  New  York  City.      UN  would  collapse  without  US  support,  most  likely.      Not  only  that,  but  additionally,  he  wants  to  get  rid  of  civil  rights  laws  that  prohibit  segregation.      Again,  you  are  looking  at  it  from  the  wrong  angle.  I  am  not  legally  required  to  allow  any  individual  into  my  place  of  residence,  my  home,  my  castle;  why,  then,  if  I  own  a  cafÃ©,  must  I  allow  those  individuals  whom  I  dislike  to  enter  my  place  of  business?  Both  my  house  and  my  cafÃ©  are  my  properties,  why  is  there  a  difference?  My  cafÃ©  is  not  public,  and  should  therefore  not  be  required  to  accept  any  member  of  the  public  within  its  walls.      How  did  that  work  out  for  us  when  segregation  was  legal?      I'm  white,  so  pretty  fine.    Still,  though,  would  you,  assuming  that  you  are  white,  eat  at  a  restaurant  with  a  big  sign  on  the  door  saying  "niggers  keep  out!"  Probably  not,  and  most  people  wouldn't,  either.  Therefore,  racist  store  owners  can  either  keep  their  views  to  themselves  or  go  out  of  business;  it  behoves  them  to  do  the  former.      Even  if  he  was  elected,  nothing  would  get  done  since  congress  would  refuse  to  pass  anything  he  created.      Even  if  none  of  his  ideas  came  to  fruition,  we'd  still  have  four  years  with  a  president  refusing  to  sign  any  more  liberty-crushing  bills.	1

in  my  point  of  view  No.  Obama  didn't  deliver  favor,  his  attemts  to  change  something  was  not  so  succeful.  During  his  carreer  as  Prezident  country  was  in  a  risky  situation.  People  in  USA  dont  want  to  elect  Obama  again  becouse  he  has  baffled  them.  My  friend  Will  from  USA  and  i  was  chating  with  him  about  this  topic.He  said  that  no  need  to  elect  him  becouse  his  promises  in  most  cases  NOTHING.  Americans  position  become  risky.	1
Yes  we  can!"  roared  the  crowd.  It  was  an  emotional  night  for  everyone.  The  2008  presidential  election  was  over.  John  McCain  had  lost  to  the  first  major  party  endorsed  African-American  presidential  candidate  in  United  States  history.  We  finally  closed  troubling  chapters  in  our  history  such  as  Mississippi  burning  and  the  civil  rights  marches  of  Selma.    Republicans,  including  the  bewildered  Religious  Right,  sat  stunned  in  their  seats  wondering  what  would  happen  to  their  country.  It  was  not  because  the  Democratic  Party  was  any  different  from  the  Bush  Administration  but  because  the  GOP  had  pathetically  lost  its  neo-conservative  bully  pulpit  in  the  White  House.    Democrats  cheered  with  glee  at  the  opportunity  to  take  back  the  power  that  was  theirs  during  the  Clinton  Glory  Days.  They  salivated  at  the  prospect  of  re-introducing  neo-liberal  interventionism  on  foreign  soil  and  overseas  markets  They  longed  to  once  again  crank  the  Dollar  presses  to  inflate  the  money  supply  in  the  name  of  the  "poor"  this  time  instead  of  "business".  They  would  gladly  finish  the  work  of  the  Fall  of  the  American  Empire  started  under  the  Bush  Regime.    And  now,  the  smoke  and  mirrors  game  goes  on.  The  crooked  politicians  of  2009  are  no  different  than  the  corrupt  politicians  of  the  Gilded  Age  or  the  Roaring  Twenties.  Crony  capitalists  like  oil  barons  and  railway  tycoons  then  lined  the  pockets  of  our  nation's  representatives  to  further  the  goals  of  Big  Business  and  destroy  the  wealth  of  American  workers.  Sound  familiar?    President  Obama  had  a  unique  opportunity  in  history  --  and  he  blew  it.  He  brought  us  "change"  indeed.  He  slammed  the  Bush  Doctrine  in  all  its  ugly  forms  of  secrecy  and  judicial  obstruction  into  executive  hyper-drive.  The  rhetoric  of  compassionate  conservative  now  became  the  drivel  of  compassionate  liberalism.    If  there  is  one  thing  Americans  say  about  Obama  it  is  this:  he  cares.    He  cares  for  the  mechanic  in  Detroit  who  lost  his  job.  He  cares  for  the  middle-aged  couple  living  in  the  Hooverville  tent  outside  Sacramento.  He  cares  for  the  middle  class  mother  and  her  three  kids  in  Toledo  spending  their  nights  in  a  homeless  shelter  with  the  addicted  and  the  ignored.    But  does  Obama  really  care?    In  fact,  his  compassionate  liberalism  runs  so  deep  that  it  pulls  a  move  from  the  old  Ronald  Reagan  playbook  we  knew  as  trickle-down  economics.  These  days  the  compassionate  White  House  grants  bail-out  money  to  financial  monsters  like  AIG  and  Bank  of  America.  There  could  be  no  better  help  for  the  American  veteran  shivering  under  a  bridge  tonight  because  there  just  aren't  any  more  jobs.  (Unless  of  course,  you  can  beat  out  the  200  other  people  applying  for  that  one  lonely  job  opening.)  The  idea  is  that  bail-out  money  will  sooner  or  later  trickle-down  to  the  great  unwashed  masses  of  Americans  wondering  what  in  Sam  Hill  happened  to  the  real  estate  market  and  their  retirement  accounts.    It  may  only  be  a  drop  of  financial  bail-out  --  but  hey  it  trickled  down.  Next  up,  bread  lines!    The  truth  is  that  the  White  House  allowed  corporate  giant  CEOs  to  loot  and  pilfer  the  public  treasury.  This  Administration  is  following  the  same  tortured  logic  of  the  previous  one  which  assured  us  that  falsely  accused  cab  drivers  from  Baghdad  were  receiving  comfortable  attention  at  Guantanamo  Bay.    The  left-right  political  paradigm  in  this  country  is  a  sham.  (Sorry  to  disappoint  my  fellow  Evangelical  Christians.)  Both  parties  have  proven  to  be  Big  Business,  Big  Government  warmongers.  For  those  who  actually  wished  McCain  had  been  elected  just  think  about  this:  the  GOP  would  have  put  up  no  opposition  to  the  new  President's  Stimulus  Package  and  would  have  rammed  through  trillions  more  in  "help"  for  America.    So  there  you  have  it.  President  Obama  is  as  bad  as  the  worst  conservative  and  as  bad  as  the  worst  liberal  --  and  all  with  a  smile.    How  is  the  left-right  scenario  a  sham?  Consider  the  following.    The  gay  rights  issue  is  a  political  distraction.  Stem  cell  research?  Just  more  Big  Research  pork-barrel  spending.  Abortion?  It's  the  political  Gordian  Knot  that  requires  even  the  most  astute  of  political  science  majors  to  bust  a  gut  if  they  dare  try  to  untie  it.  The  so-called  immigration  invasion?  A  typical  act  of  sensational  yellow  journalism  that  says,  "Look  over  there,  Bubba!  It  ain't  your  own  government  stealin'  your  hard-earned  dollars,  it's  them  Mexicans  lookin'  for  revenge  and  dishwasher  jobs  since  the  Alamo!"  Sorry,  Pat  Buchanan,  the  "Death  of  the  West"  comes  from  the  corruption  in  our  government,  not  the  immigrants  heading  back  home  in  record  numbers.    What  are  the  real  issues  of  post-election  America?  For  starters,  the  destruction  of  individual  wealth  in  this  country,  save  for  the  high  upper  class.  We  are  on  the  verge  of  an  economic  meltdown  that  will  dwarf  the  Great  Depression  and  will  take  decades  to  recover.  There  is  no  need  for  a  conspiracy  theory  here  --  only  the  urgency  of  understanding  the  mess  that  we  allowed  to  happen  and  how  we  can  financially  protect  ourselves.    We  must  not  waste  time.  We  must  move  our  already-compromised  and  over-valued  U.S.  Dollars  into  assets  of  real  value.  This  does  not  include  real  estate  unless  you're  buying  ten  cents  or  less  on  the  high-priced  dollar.  Forget  your  401(k),  pensions  and  your  annuities.  Unless  you  can  take  your  money  out,  they  are  toast.  The  stock  market  is  one  toxic  graveyard,  particularly  finance  shares.  Dump  them.  Invest  in  precious  metals,  food  supply,  cigarettes,  alcohol  and  medicine  for  trade  and  help  for  your  neighbors  when  the  Dollar  collapses.    Consider  buying  silver,  palladium  and  gold  from  reputable  sellers  like  apmex.com.  I  personally  recommend  silverbullion.com  because  I  support  the  goals  of  the  owner  Jason  Hommel  to  bring  silver  back  as  the  most  effective  medium  of  exchange.  Remember,  that  despite  the  U.S.  Treasury's  naked  assertions,  the  U.S.  Constitution  expressly  reserves  the  right  of  individual  States  to  mint  legal  tender  coins  so  long  as  they're  gold  or  silver.    When  the  dollar  collapses,  I  do  not  think  that  New  York  City  will  burn  or  that  the  United  States  will  come  to  an  immediate  end.  But  if  it  did,  the  blame  must  rest  entirely  on  Barack  Obama  and  his  Congressional  Criminal  Syndicate.    Some  might  here  criticize  me  as  being  unfair.  After  all,  George  W.  Bush  The  Evangelical  nearly  bankrupted  this  country  with  his  illegal  wars,  his  blatant  lies  to  stir  Americans  to  bloodshed,  his  deliberate  obstruction  to  the  9/11  Commission,  his  last-minute  corporate  bailout  to  the  tune  of  hundreds  of  billions,  his  economic  tinkering  with  interest  rates,  his  unconscionable  acts  of  torturing  innocent  men  and  children,  his  doubling  of  the  national  debt,  et  cetera,  et  cetera.    But  let  me  be  clear  about  this.  George  W.  Bush  is  a  public  menace.  He  and  his  cadre  must  be  tried  and  convicted  of  their  crimes.  But  that  will  never  happen  under  an  Obama  Presidency,  in  spite  of  the  President's  left-leaning  brand  of  crony  capitalism.  The  Truth  Commission  currently  at  play  in  the  Congress  is  merely  a  circus  show  to  fool  Americans  into  thinking  that  we  actually  take  seriously  the  crimes  of  torture,  invasion,  occupation,  mayhem,  pillaging,  looting,  rape,  pollution,  perjury,  bribery  and  killing  of  civilians  with  illegal  weapons  of  war.    Every  moment  that  the  Obama  Administration  rolls  on  without  prosecuting  the  crimes  of  the  former  Administration,  it  exists  as  a  de  facto  confirmation  that  our  new  President  has  sold  out  to  the  rich  and  that  he  lied  to  his  Democratic  base  and  the  American  voter.  The  White  House  today  has  continued  in  the  same  deadly  bait-and-switch  tactics  of  the  former  Village  Idiot-In-Chief.  Additionally,  Obama  has  moved  to  control  more  media  and  aggressively  solidify  relationships  with  members  of  the  "War  and  Bankers  Party"  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle.    For  a  President  to  vociferously  take  on  Rush  Limbaugh  the  GOP's  talk  radio  attack  dog  is  an  alarming  signal.  Besides  the  fact  that  the  Democrats  want  to  point  out  the  weakness  of  the  GOP's  leadership  vacuum,  Obama  is  inserting  himself  into  the  realm  of  media  and  entertainment  instead  of  focusing  on  how  his  office  can  uphold  and  defend  the  U.S.  Constitution  in  light  of  the  economic  crisis.  Are  we  really  so  surprised  to  see  the  leftist  authoritarian  Hugo  Chavez,  who  is  a  regular  media  personality,  cheer  Obama  in  his  nationalization  and  socialization  of  the  banking  and  insurance  industries?    Evangelical  Christian  radio  stations  are  scared  stiff  about  the  Democratic-led  Congress  reviving  restrictions  on  Americans  to  share  their  religious  opinions  over  the  people's  airwaves.  And  they  should  be  concerned.  (I  particularly  enjoy  my  local  station.)  After  all,  the  same  kind  of  government  that  monitors,  censors,  filters  and  controls  any  form  of  media  is  the  same  type  of  authoritarianism  that  steals,  plunders  and  coerces  its  own  people.  One  look  at  China's  control  of  the  internet  and  Google's  sickening  overture  to  that  regime  is  enough  to  make  any  civil  libertarian's  skin  crawl.  Reports  that  Australia  is  considering  Chinese-style  filtering  over  what  their  people  can  access  on  the  internet  makes  me  want  to  boycott  eucalyptus  leaves.    So  why  is  President  Obama  responsible  for  our  economic  debacle?    Because  it's  the  first  rule  of  leadership.  Everything  is  your  fault.  If  he  didn't  like  the  prospect  of  being  stuck  with  the  mess  of  his  predecessor  he  should  have  remained  in  the  Senate  or  considered  an  honest  living  like  working  for  AIG  or  Lehmann  Brothers.  Obama  has  not  only  repeated  the  same  unconstitutional  trespasses  of  Bush  II,  but  he  actually  increased  the  amount  of  corporate  welfare  to  the  Bank  Barons.  Obama  turned  a  blind  eye  to  the  Federal  Reserve's  arbitrary  usury  practice  through  the  printing  of  increasingly  worthless  U.S.  Dollars.    Are  we  really  going  to  see  a  Dow  Jones  4000?  The  answer  is  regrettably  yes  --  and  then  some.  There  are  economic  forces  at  play  that  will  no  longer  be  ignored  or  manipulated.  Human  behavior  will  always  gravitate  towards  self-preservation  and  the  protection  of  our  future  generations  through  wealth-building,  capital,  production  and  labor.  All  the  paper  fiat  money  and  government  spending  in  the  world  can  never  stop  that  or  help  this  economic  disaster  recover  without  drastic  corrections  to  our  own  cursed  speculative  market.  The  times  of  fast  and  easy  money  are  over.    President  Obama  has  not  even  finished  his  first  year  in  office  and  I  must  already  call  him  out  as  one  of  the  worst  Executives  ever  in  the  history  of  our  Republic.  Bush  II  is  close  behind.  Every  GOP  and  Democratic  elected  leader  that  voted  for  any  of  these  crooked  bail-outs  deserves  a  one-way  ticket  to  an  electoral  defeat.  Should  state  law  allow  it,  a  public  tar-and-feathering  might  be  in  order.    When  our  country  faced  economic  dangers,  depressionary  woes  and  international  volatility  let  it  be  said  that  President  Obama  failed  to  protect  us  from  the  corruption  of  Congress,  the  indifference  of  the  Judiciary  and  the  foolishness  of  the  People.  Let  it  be  said  that  he  abandoned  his  post  to  uphold  the  Constitution.  Let  it  be  said  that  he  whored  his  policies  and  his  office  for  the  rich  and  powerful,  both  foreign  and  domestic.  Let  it  be  said  that  we  voted  for  change  and  all  we  got  was  the  Raw  Deal  of  the  Obama  Failure  obama  is  a  failure	1

I  was  talking  about  issues  of  electability.  I  dont  care  about  his  age,  but  understand  that  this  is  a  consideration  of  many  people  because  they  associate  function  with  age.  He  could  be  120  for  all  i  care.    Obama  wants  to  raise  the  country  out  of  its  current  state,  and  is  doing  so,  and  also  is  trying  to  get  us  back  to  respectability.	0

And  only  between  10%  and  20%  of  the  half-retarded  american  population  is  that  fully  retarded  during  any  given  election.

He  will  go  down  as  probably  one  of  the  top  5  worst  presidents  that  we  have  ever  had.  I  believe  he  is  a  traitor.      First  of  all  he  is  hiding  who  he  says  he  is.  Took  way  to  long  to  present  his  birth  certificateâ¦if  that  is  the  real  we  probably  will  never  know.  Never  would  present  his  academic  records  from  the  colleges  he  supposedly  attended.  Would  not  release  his  medical  records  either.  Who  is  he?    Well  he  has  bowed  down  and  kissed  Arab  leaders.  He  has  treated  the  president  of  Israel  terribleâ¦what  leader  in  the  world  comes  to  the  White  House  and  has  to  use  the  back  door?      His  hero  is  an  anti-American  racist  who  hates  whitesâ¦.Rev.  Wright.  He  was  in  bed  with  Tony  Rezko  the  Chicgo  slug  who  is  now  in  prison.  I  mean  what  political  candidate  would  take  money  from  someone  who  is  being  investigated  by  the  FBI?  OBAMA.    Then  there  is  his  affiliation  to  communist  radicalsâ¦many  of  whom  he  appointed  as  Czars  in  his  administration.

"The  best  thing  that  we  can  be  doing  for  ourselves,  as  well  as  for  the  [Black]  Panthers  and  the  revolutionary  black  liberation  struggle,  is  to  build  a  fucking  white  revolutionary  movement."  And  that  is  what  she  and  her  husband  did.    For  a  long  time  she  was  on  the  FBI's  most  wanted  list.  Her  husband  is  just  as  radical  as  she  was.  Two  of  Obamas  friends.    He  failed  to  handle  the  Gulf  Oil  spill  in  a  timely  manner.    Failed  to  end  the  war  like  he  promised  he  would  do.  Took  him  three  years  to  end  itâ¦.hundreds  more  died  on  his  watch.    Putting  all  legislation  on  the  Internet  for  five  days  before  it  came  to  a  vote.    Snubbed  the  president  of  Israel.  Snubbed  Britain  by  returning  that  bust  of  Churchill.        He  appointed  Communists/Socialists/Progressives  to  his  various  Czar  positions  (without  even  getting  congressional  approval)  then  doing  nothing  for  them  after  Glenn  Beck  calls  them  outâ¦forcing  many  to  resign.    Then  there  was  his  failed  stimulusâ¦health  care  the  country  still  does  not  wantâ¦    Wants  total  amnesty  for  illegals.    Does  not  even  know  basic  American  geography  and  thinks  there  are  57  states.    Thinks  that  there  was  only  one  bomb  that  hit  Pearl  Harbor.

He  is  a  narcissist  and  his  change  was  not  what  the  people  who  even  voted  for  him  expected  he  meant.  His  change  seeks  to  destroy  the  country.

Well  except  Nancy  Pelosi  and  I  think  she  is  almost  worse  than  Obama  is.      If  he  is  get  in  for  four  more  yearsâ¦we  are  doomed.  He  hates  this  country  and  it  shows.  He  has  done  nothing  but  apologize  for  Americas  actions  since  taking  office  and  I  think  people  even  many  Democrats  are  sick  of  him  and  can  now  see  him  for  what  he  is.      Change  is  good  in  some  casesâ¦.thats  why  we  need  to  throw  him  out.  Maybe  then  he  can  go  over  and  listen  to  the  Muslim  call  to  prayerâ¦something  he  said  was  the  most  beautiiful  thing  he  has  ever  heard.  So  much  for  Christ  eh?	1

How  do  you  expect  people  to  take  you  seriously  when  you  sound  like  an  escaped  mental  patient?    Hey,  did  you  know  90%  of  all  black  men  are  secretly  working  for  the  USSR,  thats  right!!!,  they  never  disbanded,  thats  what  they  wanted  you  to  think..(insert  maniacally  laugh  here).      "He  failed  to  handle  the  Gulf  Oil  spill  in  a  timely  manner."      Yes,  a  Republican  candidate  would  have  been  all  over  that,  just  George  Bush  after  hurricane  Katrina,  right?      "them  after  Glenn  Beck  calls  them  out"      Glenn  Beck,  seriously?      "Wants  total  amnesty  for  illegals."      Ya,  only  real  americans  should  have  amnesty,  like  the  comanche,  the  mohican  etc.      "Does  not  even  know  basic  American  geography  and  thinks  there  are  57  states."      Ya,  Palin  or  Bachmann  would  ave  aced  that  one,  them  being  the  upstanding  intellectuals  that  they  are.      "So  much  for  Christ  eh?"      Don't  worry  God  will  protect  you  from  the  destruction  of  your  ccountry.[SEP]I  disagree  with  everything  you  said,  but  one  thing  truly  stood  out  as  grotesque  and  ignorant.        Glenn  Beck,  seriously?      What  is  your  problem  with  Glenn  Beck?  I  understand  that  his  religion  is  insane,  but  so  is  yours.  (I'm  an  Atheist.)    I  mean,  you  have  people  like  Rachel  Maddow;  she  makes  me  want  to  cut  my  wrists  while  sitting  in  the  middle  of  the  desert  with  no  liquids  or  food.      The  issue  with  liberals  is  that  they  simply  "check  off/dismiss"  people  (like  Glenn  Beck)  because  they  may  have  heard  some  propaganda  on  YouTube  about  how  they're  "hicks"  and  shit.    Do  your  research.  Don't  hate  him  because  of  his  background.	1
Obama  doesn't  think  there  are  57  states.  He  clearly  misspoke  and  was  talking  about  primaries.  I'm  not  a  supporter  of  Obama  but  your  arguments  are  pretty  radical  and  if  anything  just  unimportant.        First  of  all  he  is  hiding  who  he  says  he  is.  Took  way  to  long  to  present  his  birth  certificateâ¦if  that  is  the  real  we  probably  will  never  know.  Never  would  present  his  academic  records	0

There  was  some  more  to  it  but  I  forget  it  all  now.    Rev.  Wright  is  not  his  hero.  He  has  written  him  off  and  denounced  all  radical  ideas.      So  much  for  god?      Ya,  we  will  just  ignore  that  one.	0
This  country  needs  leadership  throughout  all  branches  of  government.  This  country  needs  leaders  who  are  willing  to  make  difficult  decisions,  despite  the  political  fallout.  We  need  one  who  loves  this  country,  truly  understands  the  values  we  seek  to  live  by,  and  implement  policies  that  are  consistent  with  those  values.  We  also  need  someone  that  is  willing  to  recognize  the  policies  that  have  worked  in  this  country  in  the  past  and  around  the  world  and  those  that  have  not.  We  do  not  need  an  ideologue.  We  do  not  need  arrogance.  We  do  not  need  to  be  treated  like  ignorant,  lazy  people  that  have  no  passion,  drive  or  work  ethic.  I  could  go  on,  but  I  simply  encourage  all  of  you  to  put  your  party  affiliations  aside  and  objectively  think  about  these  comments  as  you  decide  who  to  vote  for.  Our  country  is  at  a  turning  point  and  has  significant  needs.  We  cannot  afford  for  voters  to  retreat  to  the  political  party  talking  points.    Research  the  issues  and  do  not  rely  on  your  10  minutes  of  daily  news.  Think.  What  is  truly  best  for  our  country?	1

I  do  not  agree  with  the  majority  of  his  or  the  Democratic  party  positions.  Not  all,  but  enough  that  I  vote  Republican.  I  would  prefer  to  vote  3rd  party  if  a  candidate  was  viable.    An  independent  will  probably  not  have  a  chance  at  the  executive  office  for  4  more  cycles  unless  they  are  a  wild  card.    It's  cliche  to  say  this  but  it's  true;  voting  for  a  third  party  or  abstaining  is  throwing  your  vote  away  when  you  have  the  opportunity  to  vote  for  the  better  of  2  candidates.    It's  a  losing  situation  since  voting  for  a  third  party  raises  the  numbers  for  next  time  and  encourages  more  voters  to  have  another  option.    Even  though  I  disagree  with  the  President  Obama's  positions,  he  really  wasn't  given  a  good  start.  The  housing  bubble  wrecked  the  economy.  War  is  actually  a  revenue  and  employment  generator.  We  really  didn't  get  to  see  whatever  potential  he  brought  to  the  table.    I  feel  that  he  has  been  given  too  much  support  by  a  select  few  with  too  much  financial  and  media  influence.  You  can  buy  your  way  into  an  elected  position  or  have  others  pay  for  you.    Lastly,  as  much  as  I  don't  want  him  to  serve  a  second  term,  I  think  that  he  will  most  likely  win.  Mitt  Romney  has  no  personality,  a  large  body  of  voters,  the  religious  right  -  non-Mormon  -  has  rejected  him.  And  Newt  Gingrich  is  way  too  controversial.	1

If  you're  a  proponent  of  fiscal  irresponsibility,  debt,  unemployment  and  malaise  then  absolutely  yes.  Also  if  your  politics  tend  toward  the  fascist/communist  end  of  the  spectrum,  again  yes.  But  if  you  believe  in  freedom,  and  the  Constitution,  and  the  God  given  rights  of  man  and  responsibility,  then  Obama  must  be  thrown  out.  And  I  believe  he  will  be.	1

Which  is  why  Obama  has  spent  very  little  in  new  spending  and  unemployment  has  dropped  2%  since  its  peak.      Also  if  your  politics  tend  toward  the  fascist/communist  end  of  the  spectrum,  again  yes.      And  now  it  is  clear  you  have  absolutely  no  idea  what  you  are  talking  about.  Communism  and  Fascism  lie  at  opposite  ends  of  the  right/left-wing  spectrum.      But  if  you  believe  in  freedom      I  believe  strongly  in  social  freedom,  which  is  why  I  support  Obama.      and  the  Constitution      yes      and  the  God  given  rights  of  man      Excuse  me?  Umm....God-given?  Forgive  me  for  thinking  the  US  was  a  secular  state.        and  responsibility      Something  the  right  lacks.      then  Obama  must  be  thrown  out.      Uh....no.  The  facts  point  to  the  opposite  conclusion.      And  I  believe  he  will  be.      I  don't  give  a  shit  what  you  believe.  The  facts  say  otherwise.	0
Really?  Republicans  have  ruined  this  country?  Are  you  joking  or  dumb?  Abraham  Lincoln  is  hands  down  the  best  president  we  have  ever  had  (Republican).  Ronald  Reagan  (republican)  is  in  the  top  3.  Just  because  someone  claims  to  be  Republican,  Conservative,  Democrat,  Liberal,  Independent,  or  Green  Party  does  not  mean  that  that  is  completely  true.  This  country  suffers  from  a  major  disease  called  compromise.  There  have  been  "Democratic"  presidents  who  should  have  called  themselves  Conservatives  and  vise  versa.  We  need  a  Conservative  in  office  that  will  not  compromise  to  Congress  or  anyone  else.  I  was  watching  the  news  the  other  day  and  obamination  (obama)  was  holding  a  press  conference.  During  this  conference  he  was  blaming  George  W.  Bush  for  the  deficit  problems  when  (yes  he  messed  it  up)  he  has  made  it  10x  worse.  It  really  all  boils  down  to  the  fact  that  nobody  is  perfect  and  Congress  is  full  of  a  bunch  of  (Democratic!!)  greedy  bastards  (pardon  the  language).  They  really  don't  care  about  how  this  country  SHOULD  be,  they  only  care  about  what  they  can  do  to  increase  their  bank  accounts.	1

They  had  a  crucial  role  in  fucking  up  the  economy.      let's  not  blame  this  on  our  govt  or  the  "flawless"  obama  administration      The  fu..?  Obama  took  office  AFTER  the  collapse  had  begun...    What  the  heck  are  you  smoking?      I  don't  think  you  understand  the  role  CRA's  played  in  the  financial  collapse  of  the  economy.      I  claim  the  same  about  you.	0
I  don't  honestly  see  how  this  man  could  be  re-elected.  For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.  What  you  must  understand  is  that:  The  national  average  when  President  Bush  left  office  the  national  price  for  unleaded  gasoline  was  $1.75  a  gallon,  today  as  I  write  this,  the  Lowest  national  price  for  a  gallon  of  gas  is  $3.80.  When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion  $'s,  today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing,  do  your  math,  President  Bush  created  about  $1  trillion  a  year  in  debt  in  8  years  ,  Obama  has  created  $7  trillion  in  about  4  years,  I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.  The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.  Everyone  keeps  saying  that  "Obama  got  osama",  Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not,  the  Navy  Seal  Team  6  were  the  men  who  killed  osama  in  Bush's  war.  Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.  Obama  wants  to  raise  them  on  the  wealthy,  WHY!?  50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!  why  not  even  give  them  a  tax!  The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share,  they  make  up  for  the  20%  who  do  pay  taxes.  Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.  We  are  all  in  this  together,  stop  alot  of  these  govt  funded  (taxpayer  funded)  programs  and  grow  a  set  and  work  for  your  living  so  your  neighbor  doesn't  have  to!  Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure  as  a  president  6x  more  than  President  Bush.  If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.	1

Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading    this  .      Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena  .  You  have  no  point.      When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion        $10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.      today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing      But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.    Almost  all  of  our  deficit  can  be  attributed  to  four  main  spending  binges:    1.  Two  unsustainable  useless  wars  started,  passed,  and  continued  by  republicans.  It  took  Obama  to  end  Iraq  and  create  an  endgame  for  Afghanistan  pullout.    2.  Two  unsustainable,  deficit  exploding  tax  cuts  for  the  rich.  All  passed,  initiated,  pushed,  and  signed  by  republicans.    3.  An  unsustainable  social  security  increase.  Take  a  guess  as  to  who  passed  it?    4.  An  unsustainable  Medicare  Part  D  expansion,  the  single  largest  entitlement  increase  in  United  States  history,  and  likely  world  history.  Republicans  sure  are  anti-entitlement  small  government  fiscal  conservatives  aren't  they...    -    But  don't  take  my  word  for  it.  Here  is    Obama  vs.  Bush  New  Spending.      Obama  is  at  a  net  $350  billion  in  non-recession  spending  (projected  out  for  EIGHT  years).  Bush  spent  $4  trillion  in  the  same  time  period.    Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.        I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.      Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus.        The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.        The  effects  of  trickle-down  economics  and  republican  economic  policy  continues  to  be  felt...sad...    And  actually,  the  last  time  it  was  worse  than  this  was  Summer  of  2009.  Since  then,  under  Obama,  the  economy  has  recovered  significantly.      Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not      He  did  much  more  than  that.  And  i'm  damn  glad  he  bought  about  it.  There  was  a  60%  chance  that  he  was  there.  Defense  Secretary  Robert  Gates  (appointed  by  Bush  first  I  might  add)  called  it  one  of  the  gutsiest  decisions  he  has  seen  made  and  he  doubted  other  people  who  have  done  what  Obama  did.

And  this  was  only  possible  under  Obama's  leadership.    And  don;t  you  dare  give  Bush  ANY  credit  for  this.  The  first  shreds  of  intel  that  came  about  his  whereabout  (that  of  his  courier  actually)  were  found  two  years  before  the  raid.  Obama  was  president  at  that  time.    Maybe  it  was  Bush's  infrastructure?  NO.  Obama  has  killed  22  of  30  top  Al  Qaeda  Heads.  How  many  did  bush  get  in  8  years?  4...    Obama  has  been  BY  FAR  the  best  commander  in  chief  in  modern  american  history.      Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.      Wrong.  Righties  want  taxes  for  working  people,  the  poor  and  middle  class  (who  have  seen  income  increases  of  5%  in  the  past  30  years)  to  be  high  and  cut  taxes  for  the  rich  who  have  seen  income  increases  of  212%  in  the  past  30  years.      Liberals  realize  this  is  incredibly  unfair  and  that  income  inequality  is  vicious,  self-perpetuating  cycle  that  needs  to  stop.        50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!      That  is  a  lie.  Stop  being  spoon  fed  republican  bullshit  lies  and  propaganda.  They  pay  sales  tax.  Property  tax.  Estate  tax.  Social  security/payroll  taxes.  Etc.      The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share      They  do  not.        Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.      When  has  obama  EVER  raised  taxes?    He  cut  taxes  for  small  businesses  16  times.    Extended  the  bush  tax  cut.    Fought  against  republicans  to  extend  patrol  tax  cuts  and  won.    His  jobs  plan  was  over  50%  tax  cuts.    His  stimulus  cut  taxes  for  95%  of  americans.    He  wants  to  cut  corporate  taxes  from  35%  to  28%.    The  corporate  tax  actual  rate  (average  percent  paid...about  12%,  not  the  35%  the  right  whines  about)  is  the  lowest  in  decades  under  Obama.    -    But  no...he  wants  to  raise  taxes.  You  righties  will  just  never  stop  smearing  this  president  with  lies  will  you?  Sickening...      Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure      How?  In  what  area?  He  has  been  a  success.  4  more  years!      6x  more  than  President  Bush.      HA!  That  man  ruined  the  country  and  Obama  begins  to  fix  it,  but  no...he  is  6x  worse.      If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.        Something  you  failed  to  do...	0

Incorrect,  he  gave  the  order  to  kill  him  after  16  hours  of  "thought"  wheather  to  do  it  or  not      He  did  much  more  than  that.  And  i'm  damn  glad  he  bought  about  it.  There  was  a  60%  chance  that  he  was  there.  Defense  Secretary  Robert  Gates  (appointed  by  Bush  first  I  might  add)  called  it  one  of  the  gutsiest  decisions  he  has  seen  made  and  he  doubted  other  people  who  have  done  what  Obama  did.          For  all  the  Lefties  out  there,  yes  President  Bush  was  NOT  the  ideal  president  he  was  very  far  from  it,  I  will  be  the  first  to  admit  that.      Then  you  must  also  admit  republican  policy  is  "very  far  from  [ideal]."      The  national  average  when  President  Bush  left  office  the  national  price  for  unleaded  gasoline  was  $1.75  a  gallon,  today  as  I  write  this,  the  Lowest  national  price  for  a  gallon  of  gas  is  $3.80.      Jesus!  How  ignorant  can  you  be?  The  presidency  has  exactly  NO  control  over  the  gas  prices.    I  would  suggest  reading    this  .      Oil  prices  are  a  global  phenomena  .  You  have  no  point.      When  President  Bush  left  office  (not  that  this  is  low)  the  national  debt  was  8  trillion        $10  trillion.  You  have  already  discredited  your  argument.      today  it's  15  trillion  $'s  and  climbing      But  why?  Why  is  climbing?  It's  Obama  isn't  it.  That  nazi...always  spending  money.    Except  it  isn't  Obama's  policy.  It's  Bush's  that  is  driving  up  the  debt.    Almost  all  of  our  deficit  can  be  attributed  to  four  main  spending  binges:    1.  Two  unsustainable  useless  wars  started,  passed,  and  continued  by  republicans.  It  took  Obama  to  end  Iraq  and  create  an  endgame  for  Afghanistan  pullout.    2.  Two  unsustainable,  deficit  exploding  tax  cuts  for  the  rich.  All  passed,  initiated,  pushed,  and  signed  by  republicans.    3.  An  unsustainable  social  security  increase.  Take  a  guess  as  to  who  passed  it?    4.  An  unsustainable  Medicare  Part  D  expansion,  the  single  largest  entitlement  increase  in  United  States  history,  and  likely  world  history.  Republicans  sure  are  anti-entitlement  small  government  fiscal  conservatives  aren't  they...    -    But  don't  take  my  word  for  it.  Here  is    Obama  vs.  Bush  New  Spending.      Obama  is  at  a  net  $350  billion  in  non-recession  spending  (projected  out  for  EIGHT  years).  Bush  spent  $4  trillion  in  the  same  time  period.    Now  look  me  in  the  eyes  and  call  Obama  a  big  spender.        I  don't  see  how  that  is  attractive  to  lefties  but  it  just  seems  to  be.      Who  said  liberals  find  it  attractive?!?!?!    Liberals  were  AGAINST  THE  WARS!    AGAINST  THE  BUSH  TAX  CUTS.    Where  have  you  been  living.  Why  do  you  think  they  are  calling  on  revenue  increases?  To  cut  the  deficit  that  Bush  created  from  a  projected  surplus.        The  last  time  our  economy  was  worse  than  this,  it  was  the  great  depression.        The  effects  of  trickle-down  economics  and  republican  economic  policy  continues  to  be  felt...sad...    And  actually,  the  last  time  it  was  worse  than  this  was  Summer  of  2009.

And  this  was  only  possible  under  Obama's  leadership.    And  don;t  you  dare  give  Bush  ANY  credit  for  this.  The  first  shreds  of  intel  that  came  about  his  whereabout  (that  of  his  courier  actually)  were  found  two  years  before  the  raid.  Obama  was  president  at  that  time.    Maybe  it  was  Bush's  infrastructure?  NO.  Obama  has  killed  22  of  30  top  Al  Qaeda  Heads.  How  many  did  bush  get  in  8  years?  4...    Obama  has  been  BY  FAR  the  best  commander  in  chief  in  modern  american  history.      Taxes,  Conservatives  want  them  low  and  Liberals  want  them  high.      Wrong.  Righties  want  taxes  for  working  people,  the  poor  and  middle  class  (who  have  seen  income  increases  of  5%  in  the  past  30  years)  to  be  high  and  cut  taxes  for  the  rich  who  have  seen  income  increases  of  212%  in  the  past  30  years.      Liberals  realize  this  is  incredibly  unfair  and  that  income  inequality  is  vicious,  self-perpetuating  cycle  that  needs  to  stop.        50%  of  Americans  pay  no  taxes  at  all!      That  is  a  lie.  Stop  being  spoon  fed  republican  bullshit  lies  and  propaganda.  They  pay  sales  tax.  Property  tax.  Estate  tax.  Social  security/payroll  taxes.  Etc.      The  wealthy  pay  their  fair  share      They  do  not.        Raising  taxes  is  one  thing  but  if  the  president  is  going  to  raise  them  he  needs  to  raise  them  on  EVERYONE.      When  has  obama  EVER  raised  taxes?    He  cut  taxes  for  small  businesses  16  times.    Extended  the  bush  tax  cut.    Fought  against  republicans  to  extend  patrol  tax  cuts  and  won.    His  jobs  plan  was  over  50%  tax  cuts.    His  stimulus  cut  taxes  for  95%  of  americans.    He  wants  to  cut  corporate  taxes  from  35%  to  28%.    The  corporate  tax  actual  rate  (average  percent  paid...about  12%,  not  the  35%  the  right  whines  about)  is  the  lowest  in  decades  under  Obama.    -    But  no...he  wants  to  raise  taxes.  You  righties  will  just  never  stop  smearing  this  president  with  lies  will  you?  Sickening...      Barack  Obama  has  been  a  failure      How?  In  what  area?  He  has  been  a  success.  4  more  years!      6x  more  than  President  Bush.      HA!  That  man  ruined  the  country  and  Obama  begins  to  fix  it,  but  no...he  is  6x  worse.      If  your  going  to  argue  this  please  do  so  in  an  intelligent,  mature  manner.        Something  you  failed  to  do...[SEP]Of  course  some  moron  has  to  down-vote  this.

Seriously.[SEP]Bush  failed  to  fix  SS  and  wanted  to  guarantee  that  you  will  have  it  when  you  are  old  by  turning  it  into  a  401k  and  you  could  invest  it  like  it's  your  own  money,  which  it  is  your  money  becuase  you  pay  for  it  out  of  your  check.  He  was  the  only  one  that  actually  tried  to  fix  the  cause  of  it,  instead  of  treating  the  symptom  only  for  them  to  return  again  when  it  needs  more  money  becuase  it  is  already  broke.  The  Dem's  in  congress  didn't  like  this  because  it  would  mean  that  the  money  that  is  taken  out  of  your  check  for  SS  would  actually  go  to  you.  The  system  is  broke  and  there  is  no  money  in  the  SS  fund  to  pay  for  SS  right  now,  they  are  borrowing  it  in  order  to  pay  for  it.  So  who  knows  by  the  time  you  and  I  retire  if  we  will  ever  see  that  money.  Bush  at  least  tried  to  make  it  so  that  it  would  be  yours  no  matter  what  happened  in  the  future.  I  think  Bush  was  an  idiot  but  this  was  one  thing  that  he  tried  to  fix  for  the  better  that  would  have  worked.[SEP]Bush  did  a  lot.  The  left  ideal  is  blind  to  even  see  that.[SEP]Things  Bush  did:    He  got  us  into  the  unjustified  trillion  dollar  war  in  Iraq  that  has  left  a  million  people  dead.    He  spent  a  lot  of  money  while  cutting  taxes  for  the  rich,  thus  exploding  our  debt.    He  soured  our  relations  with  the  rest  of  the  world.    He  allowed  torture.    He  completely  blundered  with  regard  to  Katrina.    He  worked  to  tear  down  the  separation  between  church  and  state.    He  fired  United  States  Attorneys  for  political  reasons.    Truly  he  was  one  of  the  greats!    But  the  real  problem  with  Bush  were  the  things  he  didn't  do:    He  didn't  reform  our  financial  system.    He  didn't  address  global  warming.    He  didn't  commit  enough  to  Afghanistan.    He  didn't  address  the  rising  income  inequality  in  America.    He  didn't  address  health  care  costs.    He  failed  to  fix  Social  Security.    He  resisted  alternative  energy.    He  failed  on  immigration  reform.    He  never  got  bin  Laden.    Other  than  that  he  was  ok  :)	1

He's  a  socialist  a  Anti  colonialist.  That's  how  his  dad  taught  him  that's  why  he  returned  Winston  Churchill's  bust  back  to  England  his  dad  despised  the  Brits  for  colonizing  impoverished  nations.  Obama  is  driving  this  country  into  the  ground,  worse  president  I  have  ever  seen.  He  hates  Amercia  and  so  does  his  wife  Michelle	1
Christ  people,  it's  only  been  8  months.  He's  begun  closing  Gitmo.  He's  begun  pulling  troops  out  of  Iraq.  He's  working  to  stablize  the  economy    and    reform  health  care.  Contrary  to  popular  opinion,  Obama's  not  God.  He  can't  fix  everything  just  by  snapping  his  fingers.    What  positive  accomplishments  did  Bush  make  in  8  years?  Seriously.[SEP]First  of  all,  you  should  really  check  up  on  this  one.  Separation  of  church  and  state  is  not  in  the  constitution.  It  was  first  mentioned  by  Thomas  Jefferson  in  a  letter  to  the  Danbury  Baptist  Association.  They  were  concerned  that  the  government  was  getting  too  involved  in  what  the  church  could  say  or  do.  Jefferson  said  in  the  letter  that  there  is  "A  wall  of  seperation  between  church  and  state",  however,  he  said  that  it  was  a  one  way  wall,  that  the  state  shouldn't  get  involved  in  the  church.  He  said  nothing  of  the  church  not  getting  involved  in  the  state.  So,  in  effect,  "separation  of  church  and  state"  in  the  sense  that  many  people  think  of  it,  does  not  exist.  Also,  your  comment  about  him  allowing  torture,  is  unfounded,  especially  if  you  are  talking  about  waterboarding.  This  is  because  waterboarding  is  not  torture,  at  least  not  according  to  my  definition.  The  definition  of  torture  according  to  dictionary.com  is  the  act  of  inflicting  excruciating  pain,  as  punishment  or  revenge,  as  a  means  of  getting  a  confession  or  information,  or  for  sheer  cruelty.  Waterboarding  does  not  cause  "excruciating  pain",  at  least  not  in  my  book.  Ok,  he  spent  a  lot  of  money,  but  Obama  has  already  totally  surpassed  Bush  in  spending.  Also,  have  you  heard  of  trickledown?  It's  an  economic  fact,  and  if  you  haven't  heard  of  it  you  should  look  it  up,  because  cutting  taxes  for  the  rich  helps  our  economy.  Why  would  he  reform  our  financial  system?  The  system  is  fine,  if  the  government  would  take  it's  hands  off  the  system  we  would  get  out  of  this  recession  much  faster.  Cutting  taxes  will  also  be  very  helpful  in  accomplishing  that.  You  say  he  didn't  address  global  warming.  This  is  an  entire  debate  in  itself,  but  have  you  ever  considered  that  maybe  global  warming  isn't  caused  by  greenhouse  gases?  That  maybe  it's  caused  by  sunspot  activity  on  the  big  ball  of  fire  in  the  sky?  You  say  he  didn't  address  the  rising  income  inequality  in  America.  Sounds  to  me  like  a  principle  of  communism.  You  say  he  failed  to  fix  Social  Security.  How  was  he  going  to  "fix"  social  security?  The  system  is  obviously  broke,  but  he  wouldn't  have  had  the  support  of  congress  to  do  so.  Also,  it  wouldn't  have  been  a  problem  in  the  first  place  if  good  old  FDR  hadn't  started  it  and  all  the  massive  government  spending  in  the  first  place.      Now,  lets  compare  him  to  Obama  (assuming  everything  you  have  said  is  true):    He  completely  blundered  with  regard  to  Katrina,  Obama  completely  blundered  with  regard  to  the  BP  oil  spill.    He  soured  our  relations  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  Obama  made  it  10x  worse  by  going  on  a  global  apology  tour.    He  fired  United  States  Attorneys  for  political  reasons,  Obama  has  put  socialist  and  communist  friends  into  positions  in  the      white  house  (Cass  Sunstein,  John  Holdrin,  Van  Jones,  to  name  a  few)    He  didn't  reform  our  financial  system,  Obama  wants  to  "Fundementally  transform  the  United  States  of  America"  in  his  own  words.    He  didn't  address  global  warming,  Obama  wants  Cap  and  Trade  to  fine  companies  for  not  being  "green"  enough.    He  didn't  commit  enough  to  Afghanistan,  Obama  won't  commit  to  anywhere  or  anything.    He  didn't  address  health  care  costs,  Obama  wants  to  institute  a  socialist  healthcare  system.    He  failed  to  fix  Social  Security,  Obama:  ditto.    He  never  got  Bin  Laden,  neither  did  Obama.    Now  I'm  not  the  biggest  fan  of  Bush  either,  but  he  was  an  ok  president.  Obama  is  simply  messing  up  the  U.S.  and  rapidly  taking  America  down  a  path  that  the  American  people  don't  want  to  go.[SEP]Bush  did  a  lot.

GM  is  exactly  what  happens  when  you  have  to  many  entitlements  a  socialist  based  business.  Eventually  you  hit  a  wall  and  run  out  of  money.	1

im  very  formal  at  such  topics    only  giving  speeches  dosent  prosper  america,  he  should  also  apply  it    if  anyone  thinks  that  his  imagination  is  rich  and  can  re-track  america,  he's  wrong  since  if  it  was  so  he  must  have  won  the  olympic  venue  2016    we  shouldnt  see  him  as  first  afro-american  prez.  but  as  a  man      if  he's  great  i  didnt  heard  anything  great  to  take  out  america  from  depression    closing  the  doors  dosent  keep  you  fit,  you  must  have  dare  to  open  it  and  walk  straight  ahead	1
No  other  than  talk!  and  he  got  a  Nobel  Peace  Prize  for  it!  maybe  i  should  talk  more  often.	1
Christ  people,  it's  only  been  8  months.  He's  begun  closing  Gitmo.  He's  begun  pulling  troops  out  of  Iraq.  He's  working  to  stablize  the  economy    and    reform  health  care.  Contrary  to  popular  opinion,  Obama's  not  God.  He  can't  fix  everything  just  by  snapping  his  fingers.    What  positive  accomplishments  did  Bush  make  in  8  years?  Seriously.[SEP]How  do  you  like  the  fact  he  has  denied  skimmers  offered  from  other  countries  to  help  with  the  oil  spill  and  he  won't  let  them  because  of  the  Jones  act?.  quote  Obama  said  to  Florida  Senator.    Florida  senator:  Obama  told  me  we  canât  deploy  oil  skimmers  because  they  might  be  needed  elsewhere.  Nice!  Thats  like  me  calling  the  fire  dept  to  come  to  my  house  and  put  out  the  fire  because  it's  on  fire  and  the  fire  dept  says  they  can't  because  they  might  be  needed  to  put  a  fire  out  in  the  future  that  they  don't  know  about  yet  but  if  they  did  then  they  wouldn't  be  able  to  because  they  would  be  putting  out  my  fire.  Come  on  Jessald  even  you  can  say  Obama  has  failed  here.[SEP]Bush  did  a  lot.  The  left  ideal  is  blind  to  even  see  that.[SEP]Things  Bush  did:    He  got  us  into  the  unjustified  trillion  dollar  war  in  Iraq  that  has  left  a  million  people  dead.    He  spent  a  lot  of  money  while  cutting  taxes  for  the  rich,  thus  exploding  our  debt.    He  soured  our  relations  with  the  rest  of  the  world.    He  allowed  torture.    He  completely  blundered  with  regard  to  Katrina.    He  worked  to  tear  down  the  separation  between  church  and  state.    He  fired  United  States  Attorneys  for  political  reasons.    Truly  he  was  one  of  the  greats!    But  the  real  problem  with  Bush  were  the  things  he  didn't  do:    He  didn't  reform  our  financial  system.    He  didn't  address  global  warming.    He  didn't  commit  enough  to  Afghanistan.    He  didn't  address  the  rising  income  inequality  in  America.    He  didn't  address  health  care  costs.    He  failed  to  fix  Social  Security.    He  resisted  alternative  energy.    He  failed  on  immigration  reform.    He  never  got  bin  Laden.    Other  than  that  he  was  ok  :)	1
Obama  says  one  thing,  and  does  another.    Pulling  troops  out  of  the  east?    Obama  sent  more  troops  there,  twice  as  many  as  there  were  before.    Not  gonna  put  lobbyists  in  the  white  house?      http://americaswatchtower.  com/2009/01/29/  president-obamas-white-house-is-filled-  with-lobbyists/        Not  gonna  use  signing  statements?      http://opiniojuris.org/2009/07/01/  did-anyone-oppose-signing-statements-  just-koh-the-aba-and-some-guy-named-  barack/        The  notion  that  Obama  has  actually  done  something  besides  what  Bush  has  already  done  is  based  on  the  fact  that  Obama  makes  a  lot  of  empty  promises  and  then  makes  a  bill  that  says  "he's  tHINKing  about  doing  them."  Yeah,  the  dude's  thINking  about  quitting  smoking  too.  Obama  and  Bush  work  for  the  same  people.  Obama's  just  a  thousand  times  more  intelligent,  inspirational,  charming,  and  charismatic.  All  he's  really  done  is  made  people  believe  that  whatever  he  does,  whether  it's  continuing  the  wiretapping  that  bush  advocated,  banning  guns,  or  sending  more  troops  to  the  middle  east,  it's  PROGRESSIVE  and  trendy.  Everything's  gonna  be  ok  because  Obama  is  in  charge  right?  His  allegiances  aren't  to  the  citizens  of  the  U.S.  and  it's  not  to  the  constitution  either  (he's  done  a  lot  to  change  or  ignore  it).  He  works  for  corporate  America:  banking,  wallstreet,  and  the  new  world  order.	1

No,  the  skit  the  other  night  on  SnL  was  really  funny  and  true.  You  know  when  SnL  is  doing  a  skit  on  a  president  there  is  some  true  merit  to  it.  Obama's  inexperience  is  starting  to  show  through.  He  has  the  entire  house  and  Senate  majority  and  still  he  has  done  nothing.  Oh  I  forgot  Cash  for  Clunkers  but  that  was  someone  else's  idea.	1
Obama  has  done  something  he  has  created  more  uncertainty  and  more  job  losses  because  of  uncertainty  on  big  tax  programs.  80%  of  all  unemployment  is  from  companies  500  or  less.      Recent  poll  asked  business  owners  from  all  sorts  of  industries  about  their  business  and  if  they  are  thinking  of  hiring.    Overwhelmingly  the  answer  is  no.  Small  business  is  not  going  to  hire  when  they  are  facing  a  possible  huge  carbon  emissions  tax.  If  health  care  goes  through  another  8%  tax.      The  game  plan  right  now  of  the  President  is  to  add  more  tax  to  a  already  hurt  economy.  If  you  have  a  business  and  the  only  talk  out  of  Washington  right  now  is  not  to  help  private  business  but  only  make  it  more  expensive  to  do  business  why  would  you  spend  more  and  hire  an  employer.  This  is  the  lack  of  common  sense  that  I  talk  about  with  Obama  policies  on  the  economy.      Remember  the  lie  and  we  all  knew  that  is  was  BS  that  if  his  stimulus  was  passed  that  unemployment  would  stop  at  8.5%.  Thank  god  we  only  have  4  year  terms.  I  hope  that  someone  comes  along  a  worthy  opponent  unlike  Jon  McCain  in  my  opinion  was  a  horrible  choice  for  the  GOP  .  If  it  is  someone  that's  a  worthy  opponent  Obama  will  be  like  many  other  past  Presidents  a  one  hit  wonder.	1

The  250k  is  taxed  on  the  gross  profit,  which  from  my  understanding  is  before  all  employees  are  paid  and  expenses.  I  do  know  several  business  owners  that  fall  under  this  category,  a  company  that  makes  250k  gross  after  all  is  paid  and  done  the  owner  would  net  about  100k,  I  was  just  trying  to  make  the  point  on  how  much  work  it  actually  takes  to  make  a  profit  for  a  business.  Like  small  company  I  work  for  they  Gross  profit  make  almost  1.2  million  a  year  and  the  owners  take  home  after  all  is  paid  is  only  150k.  each  scenario  is  different.  I'm  not  totally  against  I  think  that  they  should  raise  the  amount  to  more.  250k  is  not  a  lot  when  your  talking  about  them  taxing  you  on  gross  and  not  net.  I  could  be  wrong  but  this  is  what  I  was  told.	1

Everybody  in  my  office  laughed  when  Obama  said  unemployment  was  going  to  stall  at  8.5%  I  would  like  to  see  what  economist  said  that  give  me  some  names.  I  bet  those  economist  that  said  that  are  probably  out  of  work  now  for  being  so  obviously  stupid.  All  other  economist  that  I  listen  too  the  smart  ones  all  have  said  back  in  October  of  08  that  no  matter  what  it  was  going  to  10%.

Still  waiting  for  something  positive  where  is  the  real  Stimulus  that  will  create  private  sector  jobs  which  is  where  the  real  health  of  our  nation  lies.

As  this  argument  is  stated:  Has  Obama  Really  done  anything,  Obama's  actions  can  be  regarded  as  positive  or  negative  to  the  United  states.  Therefore,  even  one  act  or  law  passed  by  Obama  would  make  the  answer  to  this  question  a  yes.    1.  If  Obama  has  done  something,  then  yes  is  the  correct  answer.    2.  Obama  has:      Overturned  the  Bush  Administration  policy  that  threatened  the  Endangered  Species  Act  by  eliminating  government  agency  bureaucrats  needing  to  do  a  scientific  consultation  on  the  effect  of  projects  on  species  if  the  agency  itself  determined  that  there  would  be  no  negative  consequence.          Obama  called  on  Congress  to  send  him  legislation  that  places  a  market-based  cap  on  U.S.  carbon  polluting  emissions  and  pushes  the  production  of  more  renewable  energy.

Announced  that  the  prison  at  Guantanamo  Bay,  Cuba,  will  be  shut  down.      *  Got  a  $787  billion  stimulus  package  through  Congress  and  signed,  decided  to  not  appoint  a  "car  czar  to  address  the  automobile  manufacturing  issues,  ordered  the  Treasury  Dept.  to  implement  tax  cuts  for  95%  of  all  Americans,  and  letting  the  Bush  tax  cuts  for  the  wealthy  expire  naturally  in  2010  instead  of  sooner,  but  calling  for  an  increase  in  taxes  for  the  wealthiest  of  American    3.  Therefore,  Obama  has  done  many  things.    4.  Since  Obama  has  done  many  things  Obama  has  done  somthings.    5.  Therefore,  Obama  has  done  something.	0
Yeah  10.2%  today  unemployment  and  still  going  higher  when  the  next  6  months  for  him  are  going  to  be  crucial.	1
Obama  more  indecisive.  He  said  that  he  had  a  plan  for  Afghanistan  in  June  2009  then  in  Sept  2009  he  says  that  the  next  12  months  in  Afghanistan  are  critical  so  he  waits  3  more  months  to  announce  to  the  nation  what  his  plan  is  going  to  be.  So  he  just  took  3  months  out  of  him  saying  that  Afghanistan  the  next  12  months  is  critical,  what  kind  of  leader  is  that?    Where  is  the  leadership?  I  have  serious  voters  remorse.	1
Obama  has  owned  the  economy  for  almost  a  year  now  and  has  done  nothing  but  make  the  long  term  prospects  for  itsâ  recovery  worse.  You  may  not  believe  it  now  with  everyone  in  the  financial  media  claiming  that  the  boom  times  are  back,  but  all  Obama  did  was  borrow  from  our  retirements  and  our  children's  and  grandchildren's  futures  for  short  term  benefits  that  will  disappear  once  the  government  stops  propping  the  economy  up.      Instead  of  focusing  on  jobs  and  the  economy,  Obama  is  worried  about  Health  Care  (I.E.  How  do  you  tax  the  rich  and  middle  class  when  they  are  losing  their  jobs)  and  Cap  n  Trade  (if  you  tax  businesses,  they  will  just  lay  off  more  people  in  order  to  pay  the  tax)  two  things  that  will  only  make  the  economic  problems  worse.  In  addition,  stop  blaming  Bush  and  the  Republicans  solely  for  this  mess.  Much  of  the  problem  was  created  by  Democratic  led  efforts  to  force  banks  to  loan  to  individuals  who  were  nowhere  near  credit  worthy  (Obama  was  once  a  lawyer  who  sued  banks  to  make  loans  to  people  who  could  never  pay  them  back).  Maybe  if  you  took  your  partisan  blinders  off  and  did  some  research  yourself,  you  will  see  that  we  have  elected  one  heck  of  an  incompetent  liberal  as  President,  one  who  promised  to  do  things  differently  and  then  went  ahead  and  did  (is  doing)  things  the  same  old  way  they  were  done  in  the  past,  with  more  gusto  than  any  of  his  predecessors.	1
Job  Summit  today.  Basically  Obama  is  saying  he  doesn't  know  how  to  fix  it  and  create  job  growth.    I'll  tell  you  how  he  could  fix  it  is,  is  to  get  out  of  the  private  sectors  way.  Or  resign  your  big  spending  agendas  which  is  the  disincentive  why  private  sector  is  not  hiring.      It  cost  a  lot  of  money  to  run  a  business  and  make  money  in  it,  if  he  only  understood  that  one  simple  principal.	1
I  just  got  done  hearing  is  speech  on  the  job  summit.          His  ending  statement  was  if  he  was  doing  anything  that  is  prohibiting  the  private  sector  please  let  him  know.      I  find  it  ironic  that  this  i  all  being  done  a  day  before  the  unemployment  numbers  come  out  tomorrow.	1
I'm  with  the  rising  poll  of  isolationist  that  believe  Afghany  war  is  going  to  add  more  debt  and  spend  500  Billion  to  help  a  country  that  only  has  two  paved  roads  in  the  entire  country.  I  was  hoping  that  Obama  was  to  withdraw  troops  and  start  to  focus  on  America's  problems.  500  billion  to  give  to  companies  to  help  build  up  there  infrastructure.  Afghanistan  is  not  a  threat  to  us,  the  attacks  of  9/11  came  from  America  where  we  taught  them  how  to  fly  our  planes.      And  we  are  to  believe  general  McChrystal,  the  same  general  who  lied  about  the  truth  of  Pat  Tillman's  death?  It's  all  about  perception  and  money  big  business  getting  contracts  is  what  this  war  is  about.	1
He  has  done  something.  He  now  wants  to  take  the  TARP  money  which  he  said  when  it  was  to  be  paid  back  that  it  would  go  straight  to  pay  down  the  deficit.  He  now  wants  to  spend  it  on  another  Stimulus.      Switzerland  today  sat  out  on  bond  sale  for  US  treasury  notes.  Did  not  buy  one.  Uh  oh  can  I  say  like  many  others  have  said,  told  you  so,  watch  the  interest  getting  ready  to  climb  up.	1
Lets  look  at  what  we  have  now.  Worse  economy  people  talking  about  double  dip  recession.  A  war  that  is  a  mess  in  Afghanistan.  Ski  rocketing  deficit  that  our  grand  children  are  going  to  have  to  pay  for.  More  confusion  on  less  overall  confidence  in  the  US  market.  Obama  has  made  things  much  worse.  He  goes  golfing  while  people  in  the  gulf  need  his  guidance  and  help.  I  remember  Bush  giving  up  golf  because  he  didn't  want  the  moral  of  troops  to  see  him  golfing  while  troops  died  fighting.  Quite  a  contrast  from  a  President  who  was  supposed  to  bring  change  that  we  can  believe  in.	1
I  think  the  question  should  be  has  Obama  done  anything  good?  (No)	1
So  far  all  of  your  arguments  are  against  the  grain  and  you  are  wrong  he  has  done  something  made  things  worde  but  come  Nov  2nd  we  are  going  to  throw  a  stop  to  him  destroying  this  nation.	1

Obama  needs  to  shut  his  pie  hole  and  stop  talking  about  the  economy  on  TV.  He  is  killing  any  confidence  out  there  when  he  is  so  targeted  going  after  the  banks  and  wall  st.  It  is  good  when  wall  st  and  banks  make  money.  As  much  as  some  people  hate  them,  when  they  are  healthy  and  profitable  the  economy  and  jobs  are  healthy  as  well.	1
A  Fight  I'm  willing  to  have  is  Obama  out  of  his  mind.  Does  he  really  want  to  economy  to  get  better?  Why  would  he  say  something  so  asinine.  Then  if  he  is  going  to  tear  apart  the  banks  then  he  needs  to  also  tear  apart  the  Unions  for  making  GM  fail  and  also  for  Fannie  and  Freddie  which  then  he  would  have  to  go  after  his  own  lobbyist  and  tax  them  as  well.    The  vial  has  been  lifted  the  wizard  behind  the  curtain  is  showing  is  true  character  and  Identity  and  the  American  public  is  seeing  it  before  there  eye.  They  are  in  panic  mode.  The  ship  is  sinking  fast  and  the  rats  on  the  ship  become  become  more  exposed.	1

Jefferson's  opinion  isn't  especially  relevant  here.  People  give  too  much  weight  to  the  opinions  of  men  who  died  hundreds  of  years  ago.  The  important  question  is  not  "Did  Jefferson  want  a  separation  between  church  and  state?",  but  rather  "  Ought    there  be  a  separation  between  church  and  state?"  And  the  answer  to  that  is  an  emphatic  yes,  mainly  due  to  the  fact  that  religion  is  irrational.      "This  is  because  waterboarding  is  not  torture,  at  least  not  according  to  my  definition."      I  disagree.  Most  people  would  disagree  with  you  too.  Simulated  drowning  is  going  too  far.      "Kicked  out  lobbyists?  Examples  please?"      Well,  when  I  originally  posted  that  260  days  ago,  it  looked  like  he  was  going  to  be  more  aggressive  about  keeping  out  lobbyists.  He  has  sinced  softened  somewhat  for  practical  reasons.  Still,  he  is  taking  concrete  steps  to  limit  their  influence:    Link        "Do  you  mean  funding  for  embryonic  stem  cell  research,  aka  abortion?"      Yes,  obviously  that's  what  I  was  referring  to.  And  I'm  sorry,  but  equating  embryos  with  babies  is  just  retarded.      "Made  information  about  government  more  accessible.

You  guys  really  need  to  let  go  of  this  stupid  guilt-by-association  shit.    Obama  is  clearly    far    from  a  communist.  Working  as  a  community  organizer  does  not  make  one  a  communist.  Knowing  a  communist  when  you're  a  kid  does  not  make  you  a  communist.  Having  a  conversation  with  Bill  Aires  at  some  point  in  your  life  does  not  make  you  a  communist.    The  brother  of  a  good  friend  of  mine  has  been  in  and  out  of  jail  his  whole  life.  I've  hung  out  with  the  kid,  picked  him  up  from  prison  --  even  let  him  stay  at  my  place.  Does  that  make  me  a  criminal?  Does  that  make  me  a  bad  person?

Christ  people,  it's  only  been  8  months.  He's  begun  closing  Gitmo.  He's  begun  pulling  troops  out  of  Iraq.  He's  working  to  stablize  the  economy    and    reform  health  care.  Contrary  to  popular  opinion,  Obama's  not  God.  He  can't  fix  everything  just  by  snapping  his  fingers.    What  positive  accomplishments  did  Bush  make  in  8  years?  Seriously.[SEP]Uh...  Well  he  got  a  TV  show  about  him.  D-does  that  count?  Hell,  at  least  the  offshoot  of  Bush's  actions  got    some    people  more  involved  and  a  little  easier  to  question  what  the  hell  is  going  on.  If  that's  anything.    But  really,  instant  results?  Democracy  is  not  a  fucking  microwave.  Or  something  like  that.  I  don't  know.  You  can't  expect  shit  to  get  done    right  now  .  Especially  with  all  of  the  bureaucracy  we've  let  happen.    Ask  this  question  at  the  end  of  his  term.  And  if  he  hasn't  done  anything,  then  don't  vote  for  him.

I  believe  he  is  doing  exactly  as  he  should  be  doing  with  regard  to  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  In  Iraq  we  are  slowly  withdrawing.  You  say  we're  not,  but    you're    wrong    .  Again  you  demonstrate  that  you  don't  know  what  you're  talking  about.  In  Afghanistan  we  are  building  up.  This  is  because  more  troops  our  necessary  for  us  to  succeed  there.  What  do  you  think  we  should  be  doing?  Pulling  out  of  both  countries  immediately,  overnight?  Think  about  the  chaos  that  would  result.

Looks  like  the  people  who  actually  know  wtf  they're  talking  about  disagree  with  you!  Obama  is  doing  everything  in  his  power  to  clean  up  the  messes  that  piled  up  over  the  last  eight  years.    What  the  hell  does  sending  or  removing  troops  have  to  do  with  banning  torture?  Not  a  damn  thing,  that's  what.  It's  a  fact  that  Obama  has    banned  torture  .      I  believe  he  is  doing  exactly  as  he  should  be  doing  with  regard  to  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  In  Iraq  we  are  slowly  withdrawing.  You  say  we're  not,  but    you're    wrong    .  Again  you  demonstrate  that  you  don't  know  what  you're  talking  about.  In  Afghanistan  we  are  building  up.  This  is  because  more  troops  our  necessary  for  us  to  succeed  there.  What  do  you  think  we  should  be  doing?  Pulling  out  of  both  countries  immediately,  overnight?  Think  about  the  chaos  that  would  result.  Is  a  stronger  Al-Queda  something  you're  interested  in  being  responsible  for?[SEP]Econ  was  my  sub  major  and  I  have  a  masters  in  business  on  college  so  I  do  know  what  I'm  talking  about.  I  checked  into  the  250K  it  is  on  gross  and  on  top  of  the  taxes  already  they  pay  so  that's  a  hit  on  small  business.  Obama  is  not  doing  everything  to  help  he  is  stifling  it  even  more.  The  whole  mess  started  with  Clinton  when  they  opened  up  the  lose  lending  so  that  poor  people  could  buy  homes  in  1993.  You  use  PBS  as  you  mainstay  they  are  government  lobbyist.  I  like  going  to  people  who  have  no  affiliation  to  the  government  like  Peter  Schiff.  Timothy  Geithner  is  a  weasel  and  a  tax  Dodger  and  he  is  an  Obama  puppet  I  don't  trust  him  at  all.  When  you  use  references  use  non  biased  entities  that  have  no  Obama  connection.  I  don't  watch  Glen  Beck.  Try  to  act  civil  on  hear  calling  me  names  on  a  debate  just  makes  you  look  bad.  I  can  talk  your  ear  off  if  you  want  to  talk  about  money,  bonds,  international  trade,  derivatives  and  what  that  all  means  and  why  this  adiminstration  is  going  to  make  the  dollar  lose  more  value  than  any  other  inhistory  driving  the  dollar  to  nothing.  So  watch  what  you  say.  I  have  done  a  lot  in  my  life  in  regards  to  business  and  trading  so  I  understand  how  things  work,  obviously  your  insecurity  on  your  lack  of  knowledge  shines  through  on  your  comments.  I  was  being  fair  with  you  and  by  partisan  and  trying  to  meet  middle  ground  with  you,  but  instead  you  through  your  typical  rhetoric  around.	1

No  matter  who  was  president  nobody  was  going  to  stop  the  bond  market  from  what  happened.  It  was  just  unfortunate  that  it  was  at  the  very  end  of  the  Bush  term  if  you  believe  that  than  your  just  an  idiot.  Do  you  know  a  lot  about  Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie  Mae  I  do  they  are  run  solely  by  the  democratic  party  and  I  can  go  into  more  about  that  because  I  have  first  hand  knowledge  of  them  and  the  types  of  people  who  work  there.  They  kept  buying  non  conforming  loans  for  years  and  the  overseer  Barnie  Frank  and  Dodd  turned  there  heads.  There  is  more  to  it  than  just  party  lines  Republican  or  Democrat  I  can  give  a  rats  ass.  I  have  multiple  business's  one  real  estate  commercial,  I  manage  money  for  a  company  on  bonds.  I  maybe  not  an  actual  economist  if  i  decided  thats  all  I  wanted  to  do  I  could  since  I  have  a  minor  degree  in  business  school  on  it  and  I  work  in  the  field  where  I  need  to  know.  And  I  don't  know  everything  that  would  be  very  narcissistic  of  me  but  when  I  see  your  lame  ass  debates  and  can  see  that  you  are  the  dip  shit  yourself  who  is  insecure  about  a  topic  that  all  you  can  do  is  go  google  it  and  then  find  something  that  suites  your  political  beliefs  instead  of  making  your  own  educated  guess,  your  just  a  biased  person  no  matter  what  will  always  look  at  the  liberal  side  whether  it  makes  sense  or  not.  Here's  some  homework  for  you  why  don't  you  go  look  at  states  that  are  ran  by  your  way  of  thinking  like  Minnesota,  Michigan,  California,  Ohio  all  of  these  states  have  had  nothing  but  Unions  and  Democratic  rule  and  they  are  now  bankrupt  or  heading  there.  You  won't  find  this  statistic  in  ANY  Republican  state.  So  let  marinate  in  your  head  for  a  while.	1

It's  the  same  old  thing  going  on  in  Washington.  No  matter  what  party  or  belief  system  you  may  have,  you  have  got  to  think  that  what  senator  Mary  Landrieu  did  changing  her  vote  in  exchange  for  300  million  dollars  was  wrong,  and  have  we  heard  anything  from  Obama  about  this?	1

Banned  torture!  that  makes  my  sides  split  Those  poor  terrorist  which  given  a  chance  would  like  nothing  more  to  kill  all  Americans.      Electing  a  judge  thats  his  job  to  pick  one  not  very  hard  to  that.    We  are  nowhere  close  to  getting  out  of  Iraq  like  he  promised.  His  original  statement  was  18  months.  NOT.  Any  rational  person  including  myself  saw  that  not  happening.  Although  I  would  like  to  get  out  of  there.    Bush  allowed  for  stem  cell  as  well.

What  Obama  did  or  what  Bush  did  has  little  to  do  with  the  real  issues  our  country  is  facing.    You  want  to  pull  out  of  Afghanistan?  Don't  you  know  what  the  consequences  of  that  would  be?  The  Taliban  would  probably  take  over,  and  gain  power  in  neighboring  Pakistan.  Pakistan  has  nuclear  weapons.

Christ  people,  it's  only  been  8  months.  He's  begun  closing  Gitmo.  He's  begun  pulling  troops  out  of  Iraq.  He's  working  to  stablize  the  economy    and    reform  health  care.  Contrary  to  popular  opinion,  Obama's  not  God.  He  can't  fix  everything  just  by  snapping  his  fingers.    What  positive  accomplishments  did  Bush  make  in  8  years?  Seriously.[SEP]Uh...  Well  he  got  a  TV  show  about  him.  D-does  that  count?  Hell,  at  least  the  offshoot  of  Bush's  actions  got    some    people  more  involved  and  a  little  easier  to  question  what  the  hell  is  going  on.  If  that's  anything.    But  really,  instant  results?  Democracy  is  not  a  fucking  microwave.  Or  something  like  that.  I  don't  know.  You  can't  expect  shit  to  get  done    right  now  .  Especially  with  all  of  the  bureaucracy  we've  let  happen.    Ask  this  question  at  the  end  of  his  term.  And  if  he  hasn't  done  anything,  then  don't  vote  for  him.  It's  that  simple.[SEP]On  an  afterthought.  I  jest  about  how  terrible  Bush  is,  but  the  truth  is,  he  was  in  office  during  a  crisis.  We  laugh  and  bash  him  all  the  time,  but  he  really  could  have  been  loads  worse  than  he  was.  Considering  the  amount  of  shit  he  was  receiving,  I  think  he  did  a  good  job.  His  administration  did  manage  to  rack  up  a  sweet  ass  wardebt  though.    What  he  did  or  didn't  do  doesn't  have  an  effect  on  my  position  on  this,  though.  It's  just  an  afterthought.	1
Obama  has:    Helped  save  the  economy    Banned  torture    Kicked  out  lobbyists    Allowed  funding  for  stem  cell  research    Made  information  about  government  more  accessible    Enforced  Network  Neutrality    Reauthorized  a  health  care  program  for  children    Made  it  easier  for  victims  of  discrimination  to  press  charges    Nominated  Sonia  Sotomayor  to  the  Supreme  Court    Begun  the  process  of  withdrawing  from  Iraq    Gotten  80%  done  with  healthcare  reform    And  tons  of  smaller  things[SEP]Please.  Help  save  the  economy  that  was  already  done  in  October  when  Pres.  Bush  and  Bernake  gave  the  TARP  funds  out  that  is  what  stabilized  the  markets  by  allowing  credit  to  still  flow.      Kicked  out  lobbyists.  So  you  call  the  billions  in  Stimulus  money  that  Obama  gave  to  ACORN  not  lobbyists  not  to  mention  the  hundreds  of  other  small  amounts  given  out  to  lobbyists.    Banned  torture!  that  makes  my  sides  split  Those  poor  terrorist  which  given  a  chance  would  like  nothing  more  to  kill  all  Americans.      Electing  a  judge  thats  his  job  to  pick  one  not  very  hard  to  that.    We  are  nowhere  close  to  getting  out  of  Iraq  like  he  promised.  His  original  statement  was  18  months.  NOT.  Any  rational  person  including  myself  saw  that  not  happening.  Although  I  would  like  to  get  out  of  there.    Bush  allowed  for  stem  cell  as  well.  Obama  just  added  more  to  it.[SEP]Bush  did  the  bailouts  wrong.  He  didn't  include  lending  requirements  for  the  banks.  Obama  did  better.    Kicking  out  lobbyists  is    a  fact  .  I  seriously  doubt  Obama  gave  stimulus  money  to  ACORN.    So  the  solution  to  terrorism  is  to  act  like  terrorists  ourselves?  We  can  to  better.  Torture  is  dishonorable  and  causes  us  to  lose  legitimacy.  Besides,  it  doesn't  work.    Bush  allowed  for  research  on  products  derived  from  the  cells  already  in  existence,  not  for  the  creation  of  new  lines.    Heh,  this  is  kind  of  a  stupid  debate,  isn't  it?[SEP]Uh  he  did  it  is  well  known  and  it  has  been  all  over  the  media  as  well  how  could  you  have  not  heard  this?  But  because  of  Acorns  latest  events  congress  is  trying  to  now  stop  the  Stimulus  money  from  getting  there.  Lending  requirements  are  the  issue  of  the  banks  and  bond  holders  neither  Bush  or  Obama  had  anything  to  do  with  tighter  lending.  Debating  isn't  stupid  it's  just  fun  to  hear  other  peoples  opinions.

It's  pretty  scary  scenario  when  you  think  about  it.      On  the  other  hand  I  had  a  real  new  rule  regulation  hit  me  in  the  face  to  day.  I  was  trying  to  surrender  and  pull  my  money  out  of  a  403B  plan  that  my  wife  has  and  before  Jan  1  of  this  year  it  would  have  been  no  problem  but  now  you  can't.  The  reason  when  I  asked  my  broker  was  they  had  no  reason  even  when  the  regulators  set  out  the  new  rules  they  targeted  403B  and  their  reason  according  to  my  broker  who  is  an  expert  on  the  markets  said  they  had  none.  Great!  So  this  is  the  great  regulation  we  where  all  waiting  for  not  allowing  people  to  get  their  own  money  out.  This  just  happened  to  me  today.  There's  a  lot  more  to  the  story  but  it  is  so  frustrating  that  I  will  get  even  more  mad.  Basically  the  new  regulation  is  a  form  of  pure  Socialism.  My  money,  won't  let  me  have  it.  I  have  to  make  up  some  lie  just  to  get  it  out  like  I'm  sick  or  something  or  I  have  a  hardship  which  I  don't  but  that's  besides  the  point.  I  don't  know  if  you  own  a  home  or  business  but  if  you  did  you  would  see  the  huge  amount  of  more  taxes  you  pay  just  to  own  a  home  or  business  it's  stifling.  The  argument  here  is  that  the  more  taxes  and  more  government  regulation  the  less  freedoms  we  have  and  less  individual  drive  we  have.  Today  for  me  was  a  absolute  confirmation  on  what  I  believe  this  admin  is  trying  to  do  and  that  is  a  Socialist  society.	0

Just  look  what's  happening  to  Europe  right  now  with  their  debt  crisis.  It's  ironic  that  you  posted  this  142  days  ago  and  I'm  now  looking  at  it  in  relation  to  what  is  happening  to  the  worlds  markets  it's  because  of  Socialism  that  the  system  is  collapsing  and  thats  why  Great  Britain,  France,  and  Germany  all  now  are  governed  leaders  who  believe  in  free  markets  and  the  conservative  party.  I  will  say  some  Dems  and  Libertarians  are  also  conservative.  But  this  guy  is  going  nowhere  his  idea  just  got  pummeled  in  countries  who  had  a  Social  agenda  and  now  they  have  turned  against.  Once  again  how  ironic  that  I  haven't  looked  on  this  website  for  while  to  see  you  posted  this  142  days  ago.  A  lot  has  changed  since  then.  Maybe  you  can  see  the  truth  to  governing  just  by  that  mere  fact.  I  will  say  one  thing  about  this  guys  32  minute  speech  a  waste  of  time,  because  he  was  wrong.	1

Christ  people,  it's  only  been  8  months.  He's  begun  closing  Gitmo.  He's  begun  pulling  troops  out  of  Iraq.  He's  working  to  stablize  the  economy    and    reform  health  care.  Contrary  to  popular  opinion,  Obama's  not  God.  He  can't  fix  everything  just  by  snapping  his  fingers.    What  positive  accomplishments  did  Bush  make  in  8  years?  Seriously.[SEP]Uh...  Well  he  got  a  TV  show  about  him.  D-does  that  count?  Hell,  at  least  the  offshoot  of  Bush's  actions  got    some    people  more  involved  and  a  little  easier  to  question  what  the  hell  is  going  on.  If  that's  anything.    But  really,  instant  results?  Democracy  is  not  a  fucking  microwave.  Or  something  like  that.  I  don't  know.  You  can't  expect  shit  to  get  done    right  now  .  Especially  with  all  of  the  bureaucracy  we've  let  happen.    Ask  this  question  at  the  end  of  his  term.  And  if  he  hasn't  done  anything,  then  don't  vote  for  him.  It's  that  simple.[SEP]Um  Warlin  there  no  excuse  Obama  he  is  so  far  of  base  that  he  is  lacking  the  ability  to  communicate  with  his  own  party.  Even  with  both  the  House  and  the  Senate  majority  to  his  power  still  can't  get  any  of  his  big  agenda  passed.  I  think  people  crack  up  when  he  says  something  like  "I'm  going  to  close  Guantanamo"  He  sounds  naive  when  he  says  stuff  like  that  then  he  tries  to  and  realizes  oh  shit  this  is  harder  than  I  thought.  No  country  wants  to  take  them  back.  No  shit  dumb  ass.      Obama  is  one  of  those  really  smart  men  that  has  all  of  the  accolades  but  lacks  some  basic  common  sense.	1

So  when  Obama  plays  it  like  taxpayers  were  on  the  hook  for  the  bailouts  and  that  it  cost  us.  Umm  no  Obama  i  think  again  he  doesn't  know  what  he  is  talking  about  when  is  relates  to  the  banks.  What  he  should  have  said  that  we  will  never  get  the  money  back  from  the  unions  he  supported  because  they  are  bankrupt  but  you  won't  ever  hear  him  bash  his  union  lobbyist  buddies.      Oh  wait  he  has  done  something  for  the  Oil  crisis  instead  allowing  oil  skimmers  to  come  here  he  would  have  then  to  get  rid  of  the  Jones  law  temporarily  so  that  it  wouldn't  impeded  his  loyalty  to  his  Union  buddies.  Even  in  a  crisis  he  stays  true  to  his  unions  voters.  It's  sick.  If  Bush  would  have  done  this  people  would  be  wanting  his  head.	1

Christ  people,  it's  only  been  8  months.  He's  begun  closing  Gitmo.  He's  begun  pulling  troops  out  of  Iraq.  He's  working  to  stablize  the  economy    and    reform  health  care.  Contrary  to  popular  opinion,  Obama's  not  God.  He  can't  fix  everything  just  by  snapping  his  fingers.    What  positive  accomplishments  did  Bush  make  in  8  years?  Seriously.[SEP]Bush  did  a  lot.  The  left  ideal  is  blind  to  even  see  that.[SEP]Things  Bush  did:    He  got  us  into  the  unjustified  trillion  dollar  war  in  Iraq  that  has  left  a  million  people  dead.    He  spent  a  lot  of  money  while  cutting  taxes  for  the  rich,  thus  exploding  our  debt.    He  soured  our  relations  with  the  rest  of  the  world.    He  allowed  torture.    He  completely  blundered  with  regard  to  Katrina.    He  worked  to  tear  down  the  separation  between  church  and  state.    He  fired  United  States  Attorneys  for  political  reasons.    Truly  he  was  one  of  the  greats!    But  the  real  problem  with  Bush  were  the  things  he  didn't  do:    He  didn't  reform  our  financial  system.    He  didn't  address  global  warming.    He  didn't  commit  enough  to  Afghanistan.    He  didn't  address  the  rising  income  inequality  in  America.    He  didn't  address  health  care  costs.    He  failed  to  fix  Social  Security.    He  resisted  alternative  energy.    He  failed  on  immigration  reform.    He  never  got  bin  Laden.    Other  than  that  he  was  ok  :)[SEP]He  was  the  only  one  that  really  ever  tried  to  fix  social  security.  His  plan  was  awesome  for  Social  Security.  But  like  typical  government  most  Libs  who  scorned  it  don't  like  to  give  money  back  to  the  people  it  belonged  too  like  me  or  you.  His  plan  would  have  gone  into  a  Mutual  Fund  or  Annuity  and  you  would  have  been  guaranteed  that  money  at  59.5  years  of  age  unlike  right  now  where  we  probably  wont  get  it  and  you  have  to  be  62.    Bush  signed  into  office  on  of  the  most  aggressive  bills  for  Auto  emissions  in  the  history  of  all  Presidents.      Bush  did  things  I  don't  like  but  when  I  hear  the  media  and  people  like  you  throwing  out  stuff  like  that  you  have  to  go  deeper  than  just  whats  being  said.    I  agree  with  you  on  the  firing  attorney  thing.  Bush  was  not  a  true  conservative  that  I  like.  He  also  signed  no  child  left  behind  which  is  a  disaster  and  was  to  try  to  bring  down  Government  run  schools.  His  reform  on  illegals  was  horrible  and  so  is  Obamas.[SEP]Well  if  you're  going  to  give  Bush  credit  for  things  he    wanted    to  do,  then  you  have  to  give  Obama  credit  for  things  he    wants    to  do:  Universal  health  care,  clean  energy  research,  financial  reform,  and  closing  Guantanamo  :)    I'll  give  you  the  auto-bill  thing,  I  had  forgotten  about  that.  But  still,  that  was  the  bare  minimum.  Bush  rejected  the  Kyoto  protocol,  which  was  the  thing  that  mattered  the  most  by  far  with  respect  to  global  warming.	0

i'm  not  sure  how  anyone  can  compare  this  president  to  the  last  one  and  not  say  Obama  is  doing  a  much  better  job.[SEP]Yea  I  thought  so.  But,  was  that  not  the  same  problem  that  kept  troops  in  Iraq  after  Saddam  Hussein  was  dealt  with?      The  very  same.  We  didn't  know  what  we  were  getting  into  when  we  entered  Iraq.  We  quickly  defeated  Saddam's  Army,  so  officials  thought  the  fight  was  over.  They  were  wrong.      That  does  make  sense,  but  when  has  that  actually  happened?  Surely  this  has  failed  more  than  succeeded?      We  spent  our  way  out  of  the  great  depression.  Paying  for  tanks  and  planes.  Paying  for  rifles,  uniforms,  and  ammunition.  Expenditure  at  this  time  was  unprecedented.  Someone  had  to  make  these  materials.  Factory  workers  suddenly  had  income  again,  and  they  could  go  out  and  spend  their  income.  This  spurred  the  economy.[SEP]Thats  not  the  question..  the  question  was  if  he  was  good  or  bad...  he  says  he  has  this  big  plan  and  all  this  crap,  and  then  he  takes  a  trip  to  Europe  and  sends  his  wife  and  all  her  friends  to  a  trip  to  spain  with  a  crapload  of  spending  money...  for  the  entire  trip,  it  cost  $300,000.  Some  example  he  is[SEP]What  does  that  have  to  do  with  him  being  a  good  or  bad  president?  What  difference  does  it  make  how  much  spending  money  he  gives  his  wife?  How  does  that  make  him  a  bad  president?  Please  bring  up  some  relevant  issues,  then  we  can  discuss.[SEP]Why  are  troops  still  in  Iraq?    Why  was  the  bailout  such  a  failure?    Why  has  this  country  only  gone  further  in  debt?[SEP]Finally  someone  has  some  good  questions!      Why  are  troops  still  in  Iraq?      It's  a  catch  22  really.  If  we  leave  the  country  will  descend  back  into  chaos,  and  most  likely  back  into  the  hands  of  a  terror  reigm.  If  we  stay  we  continue  to  spend  ourselves  into  debt  as  our  service  men  continue  to  die.      Why  was  the  bailout  such  a  failure?      The  same  reason  band-aids  don't  heal  bullet  wounds.  The  bailout  was  only  slightly  lessened  the  affects  of  this  economic  downturn.  It  doesn't  alleviate  or  address  the  root  of  the  problem.      Why  has  this  country  only  gone  further  in  debt?      Because  we're  spending  trillions  of  dollars  on  a  war  with  no  end  in  sight,  and  the  housing  bubble  collapsed  along  with  our  domestic  automotive  industry.  Did  you  know  Bush  was  the  only  president  in  history  to  cut  taxes  during  a  time  of  war?  Where  were  his  financial  advisers  when  that  decision  was  made?  We're  going  further  into  debt  because  we're  spending  as  much  as  we  ever  have  and  yet  we  don't  have  the  resources  to  back  up  our  spending.[SEP]It's  a  catch  22  really.  If  we  leave  the  country  will  descend  back  into  chaos,  and  most  likely  back  into  the  hands  of  a  terror  reigm.  If  we  stay  we  continue  to  spend  ourselves  into  debt  as  our  service  men  continue  to  die.      Exactly!  So  why  did  he  promise  he'd  get  them  out?  It  doesn't  matter  how  far  fetched  his  promises  were,  the  fact  that  he  couldn't  keep  them  is  the  problem.      The  same  reason  band-aids  don't  heal  bullet  wounds.  The  bailout  was  only  slightly  lessened  the  affects  of  this  economic  downturn.  It  doesn't  alleviate  or  address  the  root  of  the  problem.      Then  why  even  waste  so  much  on  it?  If  it  cost  so  much  and  had  only  a  small  effect  then  wouldn't  it  have  been  better  without  it?      Because  we're  spending  trillions  of  dollars  on  a  war  with  no  end  in  sight,  and  the  housing  bubble  collapsed  along  with  our  domestic  automotive  industry.  Did  you  know  Bush  was  the  only  president  in  history  to  cut  taxes  during  a  time  of  war?  Where  were  his  financial  advisers  when  that  decision  was  made?  We're  going  further  into  debt  because  we're  spending  as  much  as  we  ever  have  and  yet  we  don't  have  the  resources  to  back  up  our  spending.      Then  why  is  it  so  hard  for  Godmaba  to  cut  spending?  Why  does  it  seem  like  he  thinks  that  MORE  spending  will  help  the  economy?[SEP]Exactly!  So  why  did  he  promise  he'd  get  them  out?  It  doesn't  matter  how  far  fetched  his  promises  were,  the  fact  that  he  couldn't  keep  them  is  the  problem.      Obama  was  hoping,  perhaps  naively,  that  Iraq  would  have  been  stabilized  by  now  and  could  run  without  our  assistance.  From  the  very  beginning  up  until  right  now  we  have  always  underestimated  the  sheer  determination  of  the  force  we  are  fighting  against.  Obama  believed  that  we  would  have  made  much  more  progress  in  the  conflict  than  we  have,  and  we  could  leave  safely.      Then  why  even  waste  so  much  on  it?  If  it  cost  so  much  and  had  only  a  small  effect  then  wouldn't  it  have  been  better  without  it?  Then  why  is  it  so  hard  for  Godmaba  to  cut  spending?  Why  does  it  seem  like  he  thinks  that  MORE  spending  will  help  the  economy?        This  is  the  reason  why  economics  is  so  confusing  for  so  many  people.  You  CAN  help  an  economy  with  spending  more.  Sounds  crazy  but  it  is  possible.  The  cost  isn't  what's  important,  what's  important  is:    1)  Where  is  the  money  going.    2)  What  is  it  doing  once  it  gets  there.    The  idea  is  this.  If  the  government  gives  us  money,  the  hope  is  that  we  will  spend  it  on  goods  and  services  and  in  return  generate  revenue,  this  revenue  becomes  income.  This  income  is  then  spent  on  more  goods  and  services,  which  will  generate  more  revenue  and  so  forth...  So  by  encouraging  people  to  spend  money  in  exchange  for  goods  and  services,  Obama  was  hoping  to  improve  the  economy.      The  more  money  changes  hands  the  better  the  economy  will  be.  So  by  spending  money,  we  are  causing  it  to  change  hands.    An  increase  in  spending  has  two  benefits:    -increased  economic  activity  for  us    -increased  tax  revenue  for  the  government.    It's  a  win-win  situation.  What  often  happens  is  that  people  get  their  stimulus  check,  and  then  they  put  it  in  their  savings  account  where  it  sits.  The  money  doesn't  do  the  economy  any  good  if  it  just  sits  in  your  bank  account.  People  have  to  spend  their  stimulus  checks  for  it  to  help  the  economy  any.  Another  thing  that  happens  is  people  get  their  stimulus  checks  they  spend  their  money  on  some  name-brand  good  and  the  money  goes  directly  into  the  bank  account  of  some  rich  CEO  where  it  can  sit  for  years  before  it  is  ever  spent  again.	0

Hmmmmm...maybe  we  got  taken...[SEP]Time  to  annoy  you.    poke      poke      poke      47  million  people  have  had  to  live  without  health  care  in  this  country  for  the  past  10  years,  it  fluctuating  better  or  for  worse  over  the  years.  Obama  Care  guarantees  that  ALL  PEOPLE  will  have  AFFORDABLE  health  care,  BY  THE  LAW.  The  only  bad  part  about  his  plan  was  that  during  the  production  of  it,  the  Democrats  had  to  scrap  public  option  from  the  plan  as  a  means  of  attempting  to  force  the  Republicans  to  cooperate.  But  they  didn't,  so  they  scraped  public  option.      But  why  should  you  give  a  holy  hell?  If  you're  an  average  person,  you  need  health  care;  if  you're  a  sick  person,  you  need  health  care;  and  if  you're  a  healthy  person,  you  still  need  health  care!  Because  of  the  health  care  reform,  everyone,  EVEN  THE  POOR  AND  HOMELESS,  will  receive  all  the  health  care  they  need.      As  for  the  birth  certificate...  I  cannot  make  this  any  more  clear:    http://www.thedailybeast.com/  blogs-and-stories/2011-04-27/  obamas-birth-certificate-born-in-  honolulu/#        His  birth  certificate  is  ON  DISPLAY  in  Illinois,  and  has  been  since  BEFORE  HE  WAS  PRESIDENT.  In  fact,  it's  been  on  display  since  he  was  a  Senator.  Also,  his  birth  is  recorded  in  history;  on  the  date  of  Barack  Obama's  birth,  his  name  was  listed  in  the  daily  newspaper  of  his  birth-town  in  Hawaii.      So  he's  American...  unless  you  don't  consider  Hawaiians  to  be  Americans,  but  you'd  should  probably  keep  that  opinion  to  yourself.    And  if  you  start  spouting  crap  about  it  all  being  forged,  then  I'm  afraid  you  are  a  sorry  sorry  fool  who  only  wants  an  excuse  to  be  racist.  Just  because  a  man  has  a  foreign  name  and  a  foreign  parent  doesn't  make  he  himself  foreign.  In  fact,  I'll  cross  my  fingers  and  hope  our  next  President  is  named  after  a  goddam  Dungeon's  and  Dragon's  character  just  to  prove  exactly  how  wrong  it  is  to  search  for  an  excuse  to  keep  an  all  American  man  out  of  the  President's  chair  just  because  his  name  sounds  funny.    Or  because  he's  black.      Either  way,  you  have  no  excuse  to  be  into  this  ignorant  Birther  shit.      Good  day.	0

Obama  was  hoping,  perhaps  naively,  that  Iraq  would  have  been  stabilized  by  now  and  could  run  without  our  assistance.  From  the  very  beginning  up  until  right  now  we  have  always  underestimated  the  sheer  determination  of  the  force  we  are  fighting  against.  Obama  believed  that  we  would  have  made  much  more  progress  in  the  conflict  than  we  have,  and  we  could  leave  safely.      Then  why  even  waste  so  much  on  it?  If  it  cost  so  much  and  had  only  a  small  effect  then  wouldn't  it  have  been  better  without  it?  Then  why  is  it  so  hard  for  Godmaba  to  cut  spending?  Why  does  it  seem  like  he  thinks  that  MORE  spending  will  help  the  economy?        This  is  the  reason  why  economics  is  so  confusing  for  so  many  people.  You  CAN  help  an  economy  with  spending  more.  Sounds  crazy  but  it  is  possible.  The  cost  isn't  what's  important,  what's  important  is:    1)  Where  is  the  money  going.    2)  What  is  it  doing  once  it  gets  there.    The  idea  is  this.  If  the  government  gives  us  money,  the  hope  is  that  we  will  spend  it  on  goods  and  services  and  in  return  generate  revenue,  this  revenue  becomes  income.  This  income  is  then  spent  on  more  goods  and  services,  which  will  generate  more  revenue  and  so  forth...  So  by  encouraging  people  to  spend  money  in  exchange  for  goods  and  services,  Obama  was  hoping  to  improve  the  economy.      The  more  money  changes  hands  the  better  the  economy  will  be.  So  by  spending  money,  we  are  causing  it  to  change  hands.    An  increase  in  spending  has  two  benefits:    -increased  economic  activity  for  us    -increased  tax  revenue  for  the  government.    It's  a  win-win  situation.  What  often  happens  is  that  people  get  their  stimulus  check,  and  then  they  put  it  in  their  savings  account  where  it  sits.  The  money  doesn't  do  the  economy  any  good  if  it  just  sits  in  your  bank  account.  People  have  to  spend  their  stimulus  checks  for  it  to  help  the  economy  any.  Another  thing  that  happens  is  people  get  their  stimulus  checks  they  spend  their  money  on  some  name-brand  good  and  the  money  goes  directly  into  the  bank  account  of  some  rich  CEO  where  it  can  sit  for  years  before  it  is  ever  spent  again.	0
i'm  not  sure  how  anyone  can  compare  this  president  to  the  last  one  and  not  say  Obama  is  doing  a  much  better  job.[SEP]Thats  not  the  question..  the  question  was  if  he  was  good  or  bad...  he  says  he  has  this  big  plan  and  all  this  crap,  and  then  he  takes  a  trip  to  Europe  and  sends  his  wife  and  all  her  friends  to  a  trip  to  spain  with  a  crapload  of  spending  money...  for  the  entire  trip,  it  cost  $300,000.  Some  example  he  is[SEP]What  does  that  have  to  do  with  him  being  a  good  or  bad  president?  What  difference  does  it  make  how  much  spending  money  he  gives  his  wife?  How  does  that  make  him  a  bad  president?  Please  bring  up  some  relevant  issues,  then  we  can  discuss.[SEP]Why  are  troops  still  in  Iraq?    Why  was  the  bailout  such  a  failure?    Why  has  this  country  only  gone  further  in  debt?[SEP]Finally  someone  has  some  good  questions!      Why  are  troops  still  in  Iraq?      It's  a  catch  22  really.  If  we  leave  the  country  will  descend  back  into  chaos,  and  most  likely  back  into  the  hands  of  a  terror  reigm.  If  we  stay  we  continue  to  spend  ourselves  into  debt  as  our  service  men  continue  to  die.      Why  was  the  bailout  such  a  failure?      The  same  reason  band-aids  don't  heal  bullet  wounds.  The  bailout  was  only  slightly  lessened  the  affects  of  this  economic  downturn.  It  doesn't  alleviate  or  address  the  root  of  the  problem.      Why  has  this  country  only  gone  further  in  debt?      Because  we're  spending  trillions  of  dollars  on  a  war  with  no  end  in  sight,  and  the  housing  bubble  collapsed  along  with  our  domestic  automotive  industry.  Did  you  know  Bush  was  the  only  president  in  history  to  cut  taxes  during  a  time  of  war?  Where  were  his  financial  advisers  when  that  decision  was  made?  We're  going  further  into  debt  because  we're  spending  as  much  as  we  ever  have  and  yet  we  don't  have  the  resources  to  back  up  our  spending.[SEP]It's  a  catch  22  really.

Then  why  even  waste  so  much  on  it?  If  it  cost  so  much  and  had  only  a  small  effect  then  wouldn't  it  have  been  better  without  it?

Then  why  is  it  so  hard  for  Godmaba  to  cut  spending?  Why  does  it  seem  like  he  thinks  that  MORE  spending  will  help  the  economy?[SEP]Exactly!  So  why  did  he  promise  he'd  get  them  out?  It  doesn't  matter  how  far  fetched  his  promises  were,  the  fact  that  he  couldn't  keep  them  is  the  problem.      Obama  was  hoping,  perhaps  naively,  that  Iraq  would  have  been  stabilized  by  now  and  could  run  without  our  assistance.  From  the  very  beginning  up  until  right  now  we  have  always  underestimated  the  sheer  determination  of  the  force  we  are  fighting  against.  Obama  believed  that  we  would  have  made  much  more  progress  in  the  conflict  than  we  have,  and  we  could  leave  safely.      Then  why  even  waste  so  much  on  it?  If  it  cost  so  much  and  had  only  a  small  effect  then  wouldn't  it  have  been  better  without  it?  Then  why  is  it  so  hard  for  Godmaba  to  cut  spending?  Why  does  it  seem  like  he  thinks  that  MORE  spending  will  help  the  economy?        This  is  the  reason  why  economics  is  so  confusing  for  so  many  people.  You  CAN  help  an  economy  with  spending  more.  Sounds  crazy  but  it  is  possible.  The  cost  isn't  what's  important,  what's  important  is:    1)  Where  is  the  money  going.    2)  What  is  it  doing  once  it  gets  there.    The  idea  is  this.  If  the  government  gives  us  money,  the  hope  is  that  we  will  spend  it  on  goods  and  services  and  in  return  generate  revenue,  this  revenue  becomes  income.  This  income  is  then  spent  on  more  goods  and  services,  which  will  generate  more  revenue  and  so  forth...  So  by  encouraging  people  to  spend  money  in  exchange  for  goods  and  services,  Obama  was  hoping  to  improve  the  economy.      The  more  money  changes  hands  the  better  the  economy  will  be.  So  by  spending  money,  we  are  causing  it  to  change  hands.    An  increase  in  spending  has  two  benefits:    -increased  economic  activity  for  us    -increased  tax  revenue  for  the  government.    It's  a  win-win  situation.  What  often  happens  is  that  people  get  their  stimulus  check,  and  then  they  put  it  in  their  savings  account  where  it  sits.  The  money  doesn't  do  the  economy  any  good  if  it  just  sits  in  your  bank  account.  People  have  to  spend  their  stimulus  checks  for  it  to  help  the  economy  any.

Yea  I  thought  so.  But,  was  that  not  the  same  problem  that  kept  troops  in  Iraq  after  Saddam  Hussein  was  dealt  with?      This  is  the  reason  why...  it  is  ever  spent  again.      That  does  make  sense,  but  when  has  that  actually  happened?  Surely  this  has  failed  more  than  succeeded?	1

You  have  to  support  Obama  by  default.  Yes  it  is  very  conceivable  he  is  not  the  best  suited  president,  but  when  you  consider  the  other  candidates  it's  disturbing  he  almost  lost.  While  there  is  certainly  no  rule  saying  the  more  intelligent  candidate  is  necessarily  the  better  choice,  in  this  case  that  should  be  the  only  thing  considered.        John  McCain,  once  a  very  viable  candidate  to  lead  our  country,  has  inevitably  aged  to  a  point  where  his  health,  mentally  and  physically  is  a  legitimate  concern.  Now  pretend  for  a  moment  Sarah  Palin  was  randomly  picked  to  be  the  vice  presidential  candidate.  If  this  were  true  we  could  just  begin  by  picking  apart  why  she  is  not  fit  for  the  job  and  why  it  would  endanger  America  if  she  did  become  president.  But  for  McCain  to  pull  a  stunt  to  try  and  steal  the  presidency  as  if  it  were  a  beauty  pageant  (no  pun  intended),  he  has  just  proved  that  he  does  not  believe  he  is  "A"  the  best  choice  or  "B"  going  to  win  the  election.        Now  with  it  being  a  conscious  decision  of  his  to  appoint  Sarah  Palin,  you  have  to  be  disgusted  by  the  fact  that  Sarah  Palin  isn't  even  qualified.  It  would  be  tolerable  if  Palin  was  in  fact  per  say  a  moderately  qualified  running  mate,  but  she  is  not.  Sarah  Palin  jumped  from  community  college  to  community  college,  and  while  that  doesn't  imply  anything  on  it's  own,  after  further  research  one  can  conclude  that  it  is  because  she  is  not  a  hardworking  and  or  intelligent  person.  And  secondly  she  is  a  delusional  Christian  fundamentalist  who  doesn't  understand  much  less  appreciate  science.      If  Sarah  Palin  were  in  office  she  doesn't  even  have  the  knowledge  to  make  decisions,  not  to  mention  she  doesn't  have  the  smarts  to  make  an  informed  decision  even  if  she  did  have  the  knowledge.  Obama  is  a  teachable  intellectual  who  has  the  capacity  to  learn  and  conclude,  he  graduated  from  Harvard  Law.  Does  Sarah  Palin  even  have  a  BA  from  anywhere?  Everyone  should  be  thankful  that  Obama  is  the  president  regardless  of  allegiances,  no  rational  person  could  actually  think  that  while  times  might  be  tough,  if  Sarah  Palin  were  currently  in  office  that  anything  would  be  better  off.	0

Obama,  Bush,  McCain.  They  all  work  for  the  same  people.  Presidents  are  just  puppets  to  wallstreet.  People  are  fooled  into  thinking  Obama  works  for  them  when  really,  he  works  for  the  Banks.  The  Federal  Reserve  (government  bank)  isn't  really  owned  by  the  government,  look  it  up  for  yourselves.  When  people  get  taxed,  all  that  money  goes  to  the  Federal  Reserve,  and  since  Obama's  presidency,  over  a  dozen  trillion  US  dollars  have  magically  disappeared  from  it.

Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.  Once  people  can  find  jobs,  we'll  see  a  lot  less  of  the  blind  anger  we  see  today.      Though  Obama's  policies  (such  as  the  bank  bailouts)  are  unpopular,  they    were    the  right  thing  to  do.  In  the  long  run,  good  policy  equals  good  politics.

Perhaps  you  could  try  being  more  clear  in  the  future.      Or  perhaps  you  could  be  a  little  more  discerning  about  word  usage,  particularly  when  it  is  my  argument  you  are  considering.      All  US  economists  are  conservative  ideologues...        You  misuse  the  term  "conservative"  to  mean  "believer  in  free  markets".  This  is  misleading  because  liberals  also  believe  in  free  markets.  It's  only  a  question  of  the  degree  of  government  oversight  that  should  exist.  You  won't  find  many  purists  at  either  end  of  the  spectrum.      Conservative:  in  favor  of  preserving  the  status  quo  and  traditional  values  and  customs,  and  against  abrupt  change.      Ideologues:  a  particularly  zealous  or  doctrinaire  supporter  of  an  ideology.    All  US  economists  are  conservative  ideologues;  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  are  democrats,  republicans,  or  independents  etc.    My  argument  is  about  economists  not  politicians.  I  described  attributes  of  all  economists,  none  of  which  are  political.      (If  you  mean  the    conservative  political  party  ,  then  communicate  what  you  mean,  for  I  can  only  understand  what  you  mean  by  what  you  state.  And  if  what  you  state  is  not  what  you  mean  then  choose  words  that  communicate  the  meaning  of  what  youâre  thinking.)      Finally,  the  track  record  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  is  so  poor...the  track  records  of  the  maverick  economists  are  more  in-tune  with  reality  though.        Extraordinary  claims  require  extraordinary  evidence.  Thus  far  you  have  presented  none.      Finally,  we  get  to  the  core  problem  of  your  viewpoint.      Youâve  not  researched  the  opinions  of  other  economists  whose  opinions  are  not  the  consensus.  Case  in  point,  Nouriel  Roubini,  one  of  many  economists  who  predicted  the  current  economic  mess,  did  so  in  2006.  Nor  was  he  the  only  economist  who  predicted  todayâs  crisis.  But,  it  is  self-evident  to  me  that  you  failed  to  do  your  own  research,  and  then  as  a  consequence  you  find  that  my  assertion,    âthe  track  records  of  the  maverick  economists  are  more  in-tune  with  reality  though.â  ,  is  an  extraordinary  claim  that  requires  extraordinary  evidence.      What  is  extraordinary  is  the  fact  that  you  are  blinded  by  your  own  biased  viewpoint,  so  much  so  that  you  presumed  there  is  no  evidence  to  contradict  your  viewpoint  and  therefore  there  is  no  reason  to  consider  a  contrary  or  contradictory  viewpoint  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists.      However,  if  you  do  find  it  within  yourself  to  challenge  your  viewpoint,  you  will  find  that  there  were  many  Economists  who  predicted  the  crisis.  And  you  will  find  that  the  consensus  of  economists  was  predicting  good  times.  Moreover,  the  economists  who  were  predicting  good-times  were  mocking  and  laughing  at  economists  such  as  Dr.  Doom.      .        Yes,  it's  clear  that  most  economists  fucked  up  in  the  case  of  the  current  recession.  How  many  times  do  we  have  to  go  over  this?  The  future  is  hard  to  predict.  The  best  we  can  do  is  make  educated  guesses.  Why  is  that  concept  so  hard  for  you  to  grasp?  We  can't  predict  the  weather  with  100%  certainty,  but  that  doesn't  mean  we  shouldn't  try.      You  must  stop  with  the  straw-man  arguments  with  me.  I  am  being  as  polite  as  I  can  be,  but  you  are  testing  my  limits  of  politeness.      We  both  know  that  the  consensus  of  economists  missed  the  current  âgreat  recessionâ  ,  but  what  you  fail  to  recognize  is  that  there  are  some  economists  who  did  predict  this  recession.  Not  only  did  they  predict  the  recession,  their  opinions  were  not  the  consensus.  Albeit,  your  refusal  to  research  the  opinions  of  maverick  economists  indicates  to  me  that  you  deny  that  there  are  indeed  economists  who  predicted  this  recession.  Furthermore,  you  take  it  to  the  extreme  of  being  extraordinary,  both  in  claim  and  evidence.      If  you  find  the  above  to  be  obscure  in  terminology,  consider  the  following  illustration.    You  canât  call  my  evidence  extraordinary  when  you  fail  to  even  go  look  for  contrary  evidence  before  assuming  a  valid  viewpoint.      I  could  continue  with  this  rebuttal,  but  I  think  you  realize  the  error  in  your  argument.[SEP]Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.      Are  these  the  same    economists    who  failed  to  forecast  the  current  economic  recession?  Would  they  also  be  numbered  in  the  consensus  of    economists    who  have  never  foreseen  a  recession?  Are  they  also  the  same    economists    whoâve  never  seen  a  stimulus  bill  they  didnât  praise?  Are  they  also  the  same    economists    who  faithfully  always  promise  a  future  of  economic  hope,  lower  un-employment,  and  greater  riches?  Are  they  the  same    economists    who  can  foresee  the  beginning  of  economic  good  times  and  yet  never  do  foresee  the  beginning  of  economic  woes?  Are  these  the  same    economists    who  are  to  be  blamed  for  the  mantra  âhouse  prices  will  always  appreciateâ?  Are  these  the  same  economists  who  are  paid  to  forecast  good-news?  Are  these  the  same    economists    who  refuse  to  invest  their  wages  despite  their  prognostications  about  the  economy?  Are  these  the  same    economists    whose  powers  of  divination  are  measured  by  consumer  confidence?    Shall  I  continueâ¦?    BTW,  Obama  will  be  awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  for  economics  because  of  his  intention  to  save  not  only  the  US  economy  but  also  the  economy  of  the  World.[SEP]Nobody  has  a  crystal  ball.  We  all  understand  this.  Come  back  when  you  have  a  real  argument.  (And  no,  paranoid  ad  hominem  is  not  a  real  argument.)[SEP]Then  post  an  argument  that  is  worthy  of  being  logically  challenged.      Paranoid  Ad  Hominem?    Paranoia?  Bullshit,  you  only  hope  that  it  is  I  and  not  you  who  is  paranoid!    Are  you  unaware  that  only  some  ad  hominem  arguments  are  invalid?  Regardless  of  your  understanding  of  ad  hominem  arguments  and  when  and  why  they  are  valid  or  invalid,  I  will  inform  you  that  my  series  of  questions  is  implied  ad  hominem  but  is  certainly  not  fallacious.[SEP]You're  calling  me  paranoid?  I  don't  think  anybody's  out  to  get  me.  Last  I  checked  that's  the  opposite  of  paranoid.    I  don't  really  understand  your  contempt  for  economists  (or  rather,    economists  ).  Are  you  saying  members  of  the  profession  are  universally  untrustworthy  and  majorly  biased?  Let  me  guess:  The  only  person  who    really  gets  it    is  you.  Could  you  be  more  of  a  stereotypical  nutjob?    Anyway,  the  implications  of  your  questions  are  mostly  bogus.  Economists  do  at  times  predict  recessions.  They  don't  always  call  for  stimulus.  They  are  not  always  optimistic.  I  could  address  the  rest  of  your  questions,  but  frankly  I  feel  like  I'm  wasting  my  time  talking  to  you.    With  your  questions  you  repeatedly  ask  why  predictions  about  the  future  aren't  always  accurate,  as  if  the  answer  to  that  question  isn't  completely  obvious  --  no  one  can  predict  the  future,  we  can  only  make  educated  guesses.    Here,  since  you  know  everything,  how  about  offering  a  few  projections:  What's  unemployment  going  to  be  at  the  end  of  2010?  What's  GDP  going  to  be?  I  personally  am  no  where  near  arrogant  enough  to  think  I  can  answer  those  questions.  I'd  much  prefer  to  leave  them  to  those  who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  studying  them.[SEP]Before  I  post  a  refutation  of  your  latest  rebuttal,  are  you  willing  to  admit  before  hand  that  it  is  logically  possible  to  refute  your  argument?  If  you  are  not  willing  to  admit  the  possibility  of  seeing  your  argument  reduced  to  utter  non-sense  then  there  is  no  necessity  on  my  behalf  to  demonstrate  your  failure  to  refute.    When  you  refuse  to  recognize  your  straw-man  arguments  it  suggests  to  me  that  you  will  not  recognize  a  valid  refutation  of  your  view.    (Why  all  the  emotion?)[SEP]You  could  refute  my  argument  by  showing  either  that  I  am  wrong  in  my  assessment  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  or  showing  that  accepting  this  consensus  is  wrong  for  some  reason.    You  have  thus  far  attempted  (unsuccessfully)  to  do  the  latter.  But  you  haven't  provided  sufficient  evidence  (or  any  at  all  really).  Your  refusal  to  accept  the  opinion  of  qualified  experts  reflects  a  greater  anti-intellectual  trend  we're  seeing  in  American  politics  (particularly  among  conservatives).

Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.  Once  people  can  find  jobs,  we'll  see  a  lot  less  of  the  blind  anger  we  see  today.      Though  Obama's  policies  (such  as  the  bank  bailouts)  are  unpopular,  they    were    the  right  thing  to  do.  In  the  long  run,  good  policy  equals  good  politics.  Also,  in  the  coming  months,  we  will  pass  a  good  healthcare  bill  which  will  be  followed  by  historic  financial  reform.      He  has  the  American  people's  best  interest  at  heart  and  I  think  when  2012  rolls  around  people  will  recognize  that...  not  the  conservative  ideologues  of  course...  but  you  know,    rational  people  .[SEP]Yes,  the  mainstream  was  wrong  and  some  on  the  fringe  were  right,  in  the  case  of  the    current  recession  .  But  you  are  using  this  mistake  to  imply  that  the  mainstream  therefore  should  be  trusted  less  than  the  fringe  or  that  they  should  not  be  trusted  at  all.  This  is  the  extraordinary  claim  that  I  am  referring  to.  To  support  this  claim,  you  would  need  to  show  a  comprehensive  review  of  predictions  by  mainstream  economists  --  to  show  that  they    consistently    get  things  wrong,  while  the  same  fringe  figure    consistently    gets  things  right.  Like  the  old  saying  goes,  even  a  broken  clock  it  right  twice  a  day.    And  ffs,  it  was    obvious    that  when  I  said  "conservative  ideologues",  I  was  using  the  term  to  mean  politically  opposed  to  liberals.

Any  reasonable  person  would  have  seen  that.  Stop  being  intentionally  dense.      Explain  to  me  why  it  is    obvious  .  Because  nothing  contained  within  your  post  would  allow  me  to  validly  infer  that  you  were  referencing  a  republican  or  something  similar.      (Do  you  not  realize  the  ambiguity  inherent  in  the  term    conservative  ideologues  ?)    Shall  I  explain?      This  is  the  extraordinary  claim  that  I  am  referring  to.  To  support  this  claim,  you  would  need  to  show  a  comprehensive  review  of  predictions  by  mainstream  economistsâ¦      Very  well!    Who  do  you  consider  to  be  mainstream,  and  how  many  failed  predictions  of  the  same  do  I  need  to  present?  I  could  submit  thirty  failed  predictions  of  thirty  economists  of  the  past  ten  years.  However,  you  would  then  argue  that      A.  they  are  not  mainstream    B.  that  thirty  is  not  enough    C.  ten  years  is  too  long  or  not  long  enough    D.  or  whatsoever  else  may  suit  your  denial.    I  think  you  ought  to  study  the  history  of  The  Glass  Steagall  Act  and  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  concerning  the  Act.  You  will  find  a  lot  of  evidence  that  may  just  try  your  trust  of  mainstream  economists.      (Many  economists  assert  that  todayâs  economic  crisis  can  be  directly  traced  to  the  repeal  of  Glass  Steagall  which  occurred  in  1999.)      I  find  it  extremely  laughable  that  there  is  not  one  iota  of  reason  contained  within  any  of  your  arguments  which  would  justify  your  blind-trust  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists.      Now,  allow  me  the  license  to  appeal  to  your  sense  of  reality.  In  the  last  thirty  years,  and  more  quickly  the  last  ten  years,  there  has  been  an  uninterrupted  progression  of  the  transfer  of  wealth  from  the  lower  classes  to  the  upper  class.  The  record  profits  of  Wall  Street  are  occurring  at  the  same  time  that  record  wealth  is  being  lost  from  the  common  man.  Now,  explain  to  me  why  most  mainstream  economists  are  not  advising  anything  other  than  more  of  the  same?  Hell,  we  can  go  back  thirty+  years  on  this  truth  of  reality.    Conclusion:      Go  ahead  and  trust  the  consensus  opinion  of  mainstream  economists  and  likewise  observe  the  continued  transfer  of  your  wealth.  And  perhaps  you  may  learn  that  maybe,  just  maybe,  the  economists  are  effecting  policy  for  that  very  purpose.  Consistency  establishes  intent!  A  man  (economist)  who  consistently  advocates  policy  that  transfers  your  wealth  to  another  is  guilty  of  seeking  to  transfer  your  wealth.      I  thought  liberals  were  for  the  little  guy?  Well,  I  am  no  liberal,  but  I  certainly  am  for  the  little  guy.      What  say  you?[SEP]Yes.

It  was  obvious  because  1)  That's  the  way  the  term  is  most  often  used  in  US  political  discussions  2)  Conservatives  have  made  it  clear  that  they  will  object  to  anything  and  everything  Obama  does  or  attempts  to  do.  It  therefore  follows  that  they  will  call  his  policies  disastrous  regardless  of  reality.  3)  Conservatives  are  obviously  not    always    entirely  irrational.  The  italics  hinted  that  I  was  half-joking,  that  I  was  taking  a  dig  at  the  opposition.      I  could  submit  thirty  failed  predictions  of  thirty  economists  of  the  past  ten  years.      This  statements  reflects  a  lack  of  understanding  of  the  fallability  of    anecdotal  evidence  .  You  can't  just  go  outside  and  pick  out  thirty  white  stones  and  thereby  assert  that  all  stones  are  white.  However,  a  random  sampling  of  essays  in  a  major  economics  journal  might  do  the  trick.      However,  you  would  then  argue  that...      Again  you  assume  nefarious  motives  on  my  part.  This  reflects  your  bias  toward  paranoid  thinking.  When  are  you  gonna  learn  that  I'm  just  a  humble  seeker  of  truth?      there  is  not  one  iota  of  reason  contained  within  any  of  your  auments  which  would  justify  your  blind-trust  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists.      How  about  having  a  basic  faith  in  humanity?  It  is  not  unreasonable  to  assume  that  people  are  generally  honest  enough  to  be  trusted.        there  has  been  an  uninterrupted  progression  of  the  transfer  of  wealth  from  the  lower  classes  to  the  upper  class...      You  really  should  offer  citations  when  making  claims  of  fact  like  this.  Also,  I  think  you  are  being  a  bit  hasty  in  this  assertion.  But  I  will  agree  with  you  that  this  seems  to  be  the  trend.      Now,  explain  to  me  why  most  mainstream  economists  are  not  advising  anything  other  than  more  of  the  same?      They  are  not.  There  are  a  number  of  policy  suggestions  out  there.    (example)    Now  admittedly,  it's  rare  to  hear  a  mainstream  economist  call  for  some  radical  shift  in  the  way  our  economy  is  run.  But  radical  changes  are  dangerous,  incremental  change  is  generally  preferable  whenever  possible.  How  would  you  remake  our  economy?  I  myself  see  no  easy  answers  here.      "transfer  of  your  wealth...economists  are  effecting  policy  for  that  very  purpose.      One  glaring  problem  with  this  assessment:      "Median  annual  wage  and  salary  earnings  of  economists  were  $77,010  in  May  2006."        http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm      Seems  to  me  economists  aren't  the  beneficiaries  of  this  transfer  of  wealth.[SEP]Yes.

(Why  all  the  emotion?)[SEP]You  could  refute  my  argument  by  showing  either  that  I  am  wrong  in  my  assessment  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  or  showing  that  accepting  this  consensus  is  wrong  for  some  reason.    You  have  thus  far  attempted  (unsuccessfully)  to  do  the  latter.  But  you  haven't  provided  sufficient  evidence  (or  any  at  all  really).  Your  refusal  to  accept  the  opinion  of  qualified  experts  reflects  a  greater  anti-intellectual  trend  we're  seeing  in  American  politics  (particularly  among  conservatives).  In  effect,  you  are  advocating  ignorance.  And  judging  by  the  fact  that  several  people  have  upvoted  you,  you're  message  is  appealing.

Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.  Once  people  can  find  jobs,  we'll  see  a  lot  less  of  the  blind  anger  we  see  today.      Though  Obama's  policies  (such  as  the  bank  bailouts)  are  unpopular,  they    were    the  right  thing  to  do.  In  the  long  run,  good  policy  equals  good  politics.  Also,  in  the  coming  months,  we  will  pass  a  good  healthcare  bill  which  will  be  followed  by  historic  financial  reform.      He  has  the  American  people's  best  interest  at  heart  and  I  think  when  2012  rolls  around  people  will  recognize  that...  not  the  conservative  ideologues  of  course...  but  you  know,    rational  people  .[SEP]Explain  to  me  why  it  is  obvious.        It  was  obvious  because  1)  That's  the  way  the  term  is  most  often  used  in  US  political  discussions  2)  Conservatives  have  made  it  clear  that  they  will  object  to  anything  and  everything  Obama  does  or  attempts  to  do.  It  therefore  follows  that  they  will  call  his  policies  disastrous  regardless  of  reality.  3)  Conservatives  are  obviously  not  always  entirely  irrational.  The  italics  hinted  that  I  was  half-joking,  that  I  was  taking  a  dig  at  the  opposition.      If  you  would  have  used  the  term  âconservativeâ  I  would  have  supposed  you  were  referencing  republicans  exclusively.  Yet,  the  term  you  used  is  âconservative  ideologuesâ.  And  while  you  may  argue  that  republicans  are  conservative  ideologues  I  would  also  argue  that  republicans  are  not  the  only  conservative  ideologues.  For  I  personally  know  many  democrats  who  are  conservative  ideologues.        I  could  submit  thirty  failed  predictions  of  thirty  economists  of  the  past  ten  years.        This  statements  reflects  a  lack  of  understanding  of  the  fallability  of  anecdotal  evidence.  You  can't  just  go  outside  and  pick  out  thirty  white  stones  and  thereby  assert  that  all  stones  are  white.  However,  a  random  sampling  of  essays  in  a  major  economics  journal  might  do  the  trick.      Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!    The  following  is  an    illustration    of  the  very  reason  why  I  asked  you  to  qualify  what  you  call  extraordinary  evidence:    You  affirm  that  there  are  no  stones  that  are  white.  I  affirm  that  there  are  stones  that  are  white.  You  assert  that  my  assertion  is  an  extraordinary  claim  that  requires  extraordinary  evidence.  I  in  turn  request  the  number  of  stones  that  you  require  as  evidence  that  there  are  stones  that  are  white.  And  you  reply  that  my  evidence  is  anecdotal  if  I  present  the  evidence  of  white  stones.    Remember,  I  am  seeking  to  satisfy  your  request  to  provide  the  necessary  evidence  that  brings  into  question  the  prudence  of  relying  upon  the  consensus  opinion  of  mainstream  economists.  I  am  not  attempting  to  prove  that  the  consensus  opinion  of  mainstream  economists  is  true  or  false  in  the  future.  You  must  realize  that  I  am  attempting  to  demonstrate  the  fact  that  when  a  group  of  individuals  has  consistently  misled  our  expectations  we  must  realize  that  we  have  been  misguided.  And  unless  we  want  to  be  misguided  in  the  future  I  recommend  that  we  consider  the  track  record  of  those  who  guide  our  expectations.  Not  that  they  may  be  right  or  wrong  in  the  future,  its  just  a  matter  of  whether  or  not  we  are  willing  to  follow  the  same  course.      Iâll  address  your  other  statements  after  we  settle  this  latest  disconnect.      (You  have  assumed  that  I  am  attempting  to  draw  an  invalid  inference.)[SEP]Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.      Are  these  the  same    economists    who  failed  to  forecast  the  current  economic  recession?  Would  they  also  be  numbered  in  the  consensus  of    economists    who  have  never  foreseen  a  recession?  Are  they  also  the  same    economists    whoâve  never  seen  a  stimulus  bill  they  didnât  praise?  Are  they  also  the  same    economists    who  faithfully  always  promise  a  future  of  economic  hope,  lower  un-employment,  and  greater  riches?  Are  they  the  same    economists    who  can  foresee  the  beginning  of  economic  good  times  and  yet  never  do  foresee  the  beginning  of  economic  woes?  Are  these  the  same    economists    who  are  to  be  blamed  for  the  mantra  âhouse  prices  will  always  appreciateâ?  Are  these  the  same  economists  who  are  paid  to  forecast  good-news?  Are  these  the  same    economists    who  refuse  to  invest  their  wages  despite  their  prognostications  about  the  economy?  Are  these  the  same    economists    whose  powers  of  divination  are  measured  by  consumer  confidence?    Shall  I  continueâ¦?    BTW,  Obama  will  be  awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  for  economics  because  of  his  intention  to  save  not  only  the  US  economy  but  also  the  economy  of  the  World.[SEP]Nobody  has  a  crystal  ball.  We  all  understand  this.  Come  back  when  you  have  a  real  argument.  (And  no,  paranoid  ad  hominem  is  not  a  real  argument.)[SEP]Then  post  an  argument  that  is  worthy  of  being  logically  challenged.      Paranoid  Ad  Hominem?    Paranoia?  Bullshit,  you  only  hope  that  it  is  I  and  not  you  who  is  paranoid!    Are  you  unaware  that  only  some  ad  hominem  arguments  are  invalid?  Regardless  of  your  understanding  of  ad  hominem  arguments  and  when  and  why  they  are  valid  or  invalid,  I  will  inform  you  that  my  series  of  questions  is  implied  ad  hominem  but  is  certainly  not  fallacious.[SEP]You're  calling  me  paranoid?  I  don't  think  anybody's  out  to  get  me.  Last  I  checked  that's  the  opposite  of  paranoid.    I  don't  really  understand  your  contempt  for  economists  (or  rather,    economists  ).  Are  you  saying  members  of  the  profession  are  universally  untrustworthy  and  majorly  biased?  Let  me  guess:  The  only  person  who    really  gets  it    is  you.  Could  you  be  more  of  a  stereotypical  nutjob?    Anyway,  the  implications  of  your  questions  are  mostly  bogus.  Economists  do  at  times  predict  recessions.  They  don't  always  call  for  stimulus.  They  are  not  always  optimistic.  I  could  address  the  rest  of  your  questions,  but  frankly  I  feel  like  I'm  wasting  my  time  talking  to  you.    With  your  questions  you  repeatedly  ask  why  predictions  about  the  future  aren't  always  accurate,  as  if  the  answer  to  that  question  isn't  completely  obvious  --  no  one  can  predict  the  future,  we  can  only  make  educated  guesses.    Here,  since  you  know  everything,  how  about  offering  a  few  projections:  What's  unemployment  going  to  be  at  the  end  of  2010?  What's  GDP  going  to  be?  I  personally  am  no  where  near  arrogant  enough  to  think  I  can  answer  those  questions.  I'd  much  prefer  to  leave  them  to  those  who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  studying  them.[SEP]Before  I  post  a  refutation  of  your  latest  rebuttal,  are  you  willing  to  admit  before  hand  that  it  is  logically  possible  to  refute  your  argument?

No.  When  I  say  economists  in  general  can  be  trusted  I'm  obviously  not  referring  to    every  economist  in  existence  .  I'm  saying    in  general    --    on  average    --    for  the  most  part  .  You  already  stated  that  you  understood  this.    You  have  affirmed  that  there  are  at  least  a  few  unscrupulous  economists  on  planet  Earth.  This  is  a  reasonable  claim.  You  then  suggest  that  we  should  not  rely  on  the  consensus  opinion  of  mainstream  economists.  This  is    not    a  reasonable  claim.  Without  a  logically  sound  measurement  of  the  ratio  of  unscrupulous  to  scrupulous  economists  we  can  draw  no  conclusions  about  the  trustworthiness  of  the  consensus  opinon  of  the  profession  as  a  whole.    To  continue  beating  this  analogy  to  death...  there  are  white  stones  and  there  are  non-white  stones.  We  can  make  no  sound  assertions  about  the    ratio    of  white  to  non-white  stones  without  some  logically  sound  measurement.  Grabbing  a  bunch  of  white  stones  and  saying  "Just  look  at  'em!"  is  called    cherry-picking  ,  and  it  is  not  a  logically  sound  measurement.    Further,  since  we're  talking  about  human  beings  and  not  stones,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  they  are,  for  the  most  part,  acting  in  good  faith.  To  suggest  that  unscrupulous  economists  outnumber  scrupulous  economists,  or  to  suggest  that  the  body  of  unscrupulous  economists  is  sufficiently  powerful  so  as  to  render  untrustworthy  the  consensus  opinion  of  the  profession  as  a  whole...  This  is  an  extraordinary  claim  and  as  such  requires  extraordinary  evidence...  Such  as  a  random  sampling  of  predictions  made  in  a  major  journal  or  newspaper.      ...a  group  of  individuals  has  consistently  misled  our  expectations...      The  keyword  there  is  "consistently".  You  have  not  demonstrated  they    consistently    get  things  wrong  and  cannot  do  so  with  cherry  picked  anecdotes.[SEP]Yes.

Yet,  I  do  agree  that  Peter,  Dr,  Doom,  Robert  Chapman,  Joe  Stiglitz  and  a  few  other  economists  accurately  predicted  the  current  economic  recession.  They  seem  to  be  the  only  economists  who  have  the  balls  to  tell  the  public  that  all  is  not  rosy  in  the  future  while  their  counterparts  offer-up  optimistic  appraisals  of  the  coming  party.    Their  counterparts,  who  seem  to  receive  a  lot  of  media  attention,  universally  and  unanimously  always  see  the  US  economy  through  rose-colored  glasses.  Coincidently,  they  are  the  same  economists  whose  opinions  make  headline  news  and  whose  opinions  are  sought  by  politicians.      However,  the  economists  I  named  are  extremely  wary  of  the  gigantic  stimuli  of  the  worldâs  governments  and  Central  banks  (  the  stimuli:  The  race  to  debase  the  worlds  currencies).  But  their  politically,  friendly  counterparts  have  nothing  but  praise  for  the  same.  And  it  is  this  latter  group  of  economists  from  which  dull-minded  Americans  seem  to  derive  hopium.	1

Its  not  a  matter  of  people  finding  jobs  so  much  as  it  is  companies  hiring  those  people.      It  is  my  opinion  that  the  current  administrations  policies  are  not  favorable  for  that  happening.

He  has  the  American  people's  best  interest  at  heart  and  I  think  when  2012  rolls  around  people  will  recognize  that...  not  the  conservative  ideologues  of  course...  but  you  know,    rational  people  .[SEP]Doesn't  saying  "Economists  expect"  suggest  that  they  are  all  in  agreement?  That  is  not  the  case.  Not  all  economists  agree  with  that.  There  are  very  successful  and  reputable  economists  that  say  that  we  have  not  seen  the  worst  of  it  yet!    Its  not  a  matter  of  people  finding  jobs  so  much  as  it  is  companies  hiring  those  people.      It  is  my  opinion  that  the  current  administrations  policies  are  not  favorable  for  that  happening.    I  disagree  with  your  assertion  that  the  bail  outs  were  the  correct  thing  to  do  but  that  is  another  debate.      Just  my  opinion.    Looking  forward  to  your  "rational"  response.  :_)[SEP]You  are  correct  with  that  they  do  expect  us  to  see  more  pain  ahead  how  much  more  I  don't  know.  But  when  you  are  talking  about  a  huge  budget,  increase  with  more  taxes  during  a  time  when  people  and  employer's  are  struggling  to  make  it,  it  leaves  no  incentive  to  hire.  i  attend  a  monthly  business  group  here  in  Charlotte  NC  with  different  companies  and  they  all  say  the  same  thing  there  is  a  big  issue  with  uncertainty  and  confidence  is  low.  The  biggest  concerns  lie  with  new  legislation  that  will  require  more  capital  from  companies  in  time  when  capital  is  needed.	1
Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.  Once  people  can  find  jobs,  we'll  see  a  lot  less  of  the  blind  anger  we  see  today.

If  you  ask  them  where  are  the  new  jobs  they  don't  know.  He  has  at  least  2.5  years  to  do  something  and  to  have  hopes  of  re-election  but  juding  by  the  recent  races  in  New  Jersey  and  Virgina  his  base  has  made  a  shift  that  Obama  should  have  concern  about.  We  shall  see!  I  hope  for  all  of  us  that  things  get  better.	1
Jesus  some  people  are  retarded.      @  Itsnotright:    Banished?  You  didnt  even  spell  it  right  you  redneck  retard.  What  are  you  doing  on  a  computer  anyway?    As  for  the  question.  Because  most  Americans  are  as  stupid  as  "itsnotright"  I  would  have  to  say  that  the  economy  has  to  just  start  making  a  come  back  around  the  time  of  the  re-election.  If  it  gets  better  and  stays  better  earlier  then  all  the  gun  toting  gay  hating  people  will  come  out  and  vote  for  the  republican.  If  it  doesnt  happen  at  all  or  only  minimally  then  people  will  blame  him  for  not  doing  a  good  job  and  will  vote  the  other  way.      I  voted  yes  on  this  question  because  I  do  think  he  will  bring  the  economy  around  but  I  think  it  will  take  about  three  years  which  is  right  around  election  time.	0
I'd  say  it's  a  little  early  to  tell.  We've  not  even  gotten  to  the  one-year  mark  since  his  inauguration.      And  there's  no  telling  what  the  next  two  years  will  hold  for  our  country.  It  will  surely  depend  on  what  additional  issues  we  face  and  how  they  are  dealt  with.      Although  on  the  basis  of  his  current  work,  so  long  as  the  economy  does  rebound  within  the  next  year,  and  nothing  else  happens,  he'd  win  a  second  term.	0
He  will  win  the  Nobel  prize  in  economics  weeks  before  his  re-election  that  November.      (Don't  forget  Clinton's  slogan:  "Its  the  economy,  stupid!")      It  worked  for  Slick  Willie,  it  too  shall  work  for  Obama.	0

Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.      Are  these  the  same    economists    who  failed  to  forecast  the  current  economic  recession?  Would  they  also  be  numbered  in  the  consensus  of    economists    who  have  never  foreseen  a  recession?

We  all  understand  this.  Come  back  when  you  have  a  real  argument.  (And  no,  paranoid  ad  hominem  is  not  a  real  argument.)	0
Yes  he  will  because  he  has  helped  alot  and  he  hasn't  been  in  office  a  full  year  yet.  It's  time  for  change  and  I  think  Obama  is  going  to  be  the  one  who  makes  the  change.  People  need  to  start  supporting  him  more  and  understand  that  the  world  was  messed  up  before  he  got  in  office.  He  has  made  a  lot  of  things  better  so  yes  he  will  win  in  2012.	0
No  matter  what  happens  with  Obama's  policies,  the  Republicans  have  moved  too  far  to  the  right  to  produce  a  candidate  with  moderate  appeal.  While  the  Republican  nominee  used  to  be  decided  with  a  lot  of  input  from  party  elites,  the  far  right  talk  shows  have  taken  over  the  party  since  Obama's  election.  Glenn  Beck  and  Rush  Limbaugh  will  not  allow  moderates  like  Giuliani  or  Huckabee,  or  even  traditional  Republicans  like  Gingrich  to  become  the  Republican  nominee.  Instead,  far  right  "heroes"  such  as  Palin  will  dominate  the  nomination  process.  These  candidates  will  inevitably  run  poor  campaigns  that  focus  on  false  and  trite  attacks  that  the  electorate  is  no  longer  as  vulnerable  to  due  to  the  widespread  internet  and  decline  of  a  single,  easily  influenced  mass  media.  However,  the  Republicans  will  give  a  strong  convention  that  will  make  people  wonder  if  Obama  is  vulnerable,  until  a  disastrous  performance  in  the  debates  eliminates  whatever  hope  they  had.  Thereafter,  the  Republican  campaign  will  devolve  into  infighting  and  will  run  out  of  money  due  to  the  poor  management  skills  of  its  leadership,  which  will  cause  all  but  approximately  40%  of  electorate,  representing  essentially  tea-baggers,  loyal  republicans,  and  mistake  voters,  to  turn  against  them.  Obama  will  then  win  by  a  clear  margin.	0

Hillary  Clinton  would  have  probably  been  President  if  not  for  Obama.      Don't  make  this  a  racial  issue  because  if  Obama  fails  miserably  than  what  does  that  do  for  history  and  the  first  African-American  President?	1
Saddly  yes,  I  HOPE  not,  but  yes.    Because  people  don't  really  realize  what  he's  doing,  they  just  take  him  because  he's  African  American  and  they  want  ~  ~  CHANGE  ~  ~.

Yes,  Obama  will  win  in  2012  because  by  the  then,  the  economy  will  bounce  back  to  a  decent  level  of  satisfaction.  Besides,  there  is  no  real  Republican  who  can  challenge  him  right  now  with  a  so  called  celebrity  status.

Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.      Are  these  the  same    economists    who  failed  to  forecast  the  current  economic  recession?

We  all  understand  this.  Come  back  when  you  have  a  real  argument.

I  could  address  the  rest  of  your  questions,  but  frankly  I  feel  like  I'm  wasting  my  time  talking  to  you.    With  your  questions  you  repeatedly  ask  why  predictions  about  the  future  aren't  always  accurate,  as  if  the  answer  to  that  question  isn't  completely  obvious  --  no  one  can  predict  the  future,  we  can  only  make  educated  guesses.    Here,  since  you  know  everything,  how  about  offering  a  few  projections:  What's  unemployment  going  to  be  at  the  end  of  2010?  What's  GDP  going  to  be?  I  personally  am  no  where  near  arrogant  enough  to  think  I  can  answer  those  questions.  I'd  much  prefer  to  leave  them  to  those  who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  studying  them.	0
I'm  not  saying  this  is  definite  or  anything  and  I  don't  want  to  jinx  it,  but  if  New  Jersey  can  elect  a    Republican  governor  ,  then  there  is  still  hope.  New  Jersey  is  one  of  the  most  liberal/democratic  states  due  to  its  population  density  and  urban  background,  but  on  Tuesday,  we  elected  Chris  Christie  as  the  next  governor  of  the  state,  a  Republican.  :D    Also,  I  feel  like  Obama  had  so  much  hype  that  a  lot  of  Americans  are  sort  of  disillusioned.  Of  course,  many  still  think  he's  the  Messiah,  but  more  and  more  people  who  voted  for  him  and  supported  him  are  realizing  that  he's  not  doing  nearly  as  much  as  he  said  he  would.[SEP]Hey  nice  job  electing  Chris  Christie!

I  think  that  the  ONLY  way  republicans  win  this  debate  is  through  Ron  Paul  he  is  the  best  candidate  and  the  most  liked!	0
I  don't  think  so.  He  won  becuase  a  large  independant  base  and  even  Republican  base  voted  for  him  I  am  one  of  those.  His  ideals  and  policies  are  too  radical  and  he  may  have  a  tough  time  getting  re-elected.  His  best  hope  is  that  the  GOP  does  a  bonehead  move  and  put  another  McCain  Palin  like  ticket.  IF  someone  like  Bob  McDonell  runs  I  think  Obama  will  lose.	1

Most  of  his  support  was  based  off  of  Bush's  failures.  The  American  public  failed  to  realize  that  Bush  does  not  equal  McCain.  Instead,  they  assumed  McCain  would  do  the  same  things  as  Bush.  Also,  they  saw  Obama  as  sort  of  a  messiah,  a  savior  for  America.	1
Well,  i  m  not  saying  that  he  is  not  going  to,  but  i  dont  want  him  to....he  is  messing  up  our  country!!!	1

Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.  Once  people  can  find  jobs,  we'll  see  a  lot  less  of  the  blind  anger  we  see  today.

I  dont  think  he  should  get  voted  in  again...we  have  people  over  here  starving  to  death,people  who  cant  afford  to  go  to  the  doctor,no  jobs  anywhere....but  yet  lets  send  7.3  billion  dollars  to  another  country  to  help  them  out...it  dont  make  sence.  you  have  to  take  care  of  your  own  first	1
um..no.  i  hope  to  god  he  don't.  he  is  trying  to  make  schools  go  year  round....screw  him.  i  mean  i'm  a  junior  and  he  doesn't  need  to  go  running  everyone  lives.  he  needs  to  get  a  hobby  and  stand  down  as  president.  in  the  end  someone  will  take  a  stand  and  tell  that  man  how  they  truly  feel  about  him.  85%  of  Tennesseans  voted  for  him  out  of  pity.  McCain  should  have  won....i  would  have  voted  for  him  if  i  was  old  enough.	1
I  don't  think  he'll  make  it  that  far.  And  NO,  I'm  not  talking  about  that.  I  think  he'll  be  bannished  before  then.	1
No  because  obama  sucks.  He  said  hes  not  going  to  send  any  more  troops  to  Iraq  but  i  heard  he  did  so  he  is  a  liar  i  don't  like  him.  So  no  i  don't  think  he  going  to  win  in  2012.	1
No!    At  least  I  hope  he  doesn't.    The  thing  I  don't  get  is  that  every  thing  that  went  wrong  during  the  Bush  Administration  is  Bush's  fault.    Everything  that  has  gone  wrong  in  the  Obama  administration  is  the  people's  fault  because  we  voted  for  him  (even  though  I  didn't  vote  for  him)	1

I  think  that  obama  wont  win  year  2012  because  there  are  a  lot  of  people  that  were  really  angry  with  the  outcome  and  with  more  teens  become  the  age  to  vote  then  I  feel  that  if  he  does  apply  again  for  president  he  won't  win.  .  .  Unless  the  candidates  are  even  stupider  then  him..	1
obama  has  done  such  a  horrible  job  as  president  so  far  and  more  and  more  people  are  staring  to  realize  it  every  day  so  i  dont  even  think  he  should  be  nominated  for  the  democratic  party  for  the  2012  election.	1
Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.  Once  people  can  find  jobs,  we'll  see  a  lot  less  of  the  blind  anger  we  see  today.      Though  Obama's  policies  (such  as  the  bank  bailouts)  are  unpopular,  they    were    the  right  thing  to  do.  In  the  long  run,  good  policy  equals  good  politics.  Also,  in  the  coming  months,  we  will  pass  a  good  healthcare  bill  which  will  be  followed  by  historic  financial  reform.      He  has  the  American  people's  best  interest  at  heart  and  I  think  when  2012  rolls  around  people  will  recognize  that...  not  the  conservative  ideologues  of  course...  but  you  know,    rational  people  .[SEP]Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.      Are  these  the  same    economists    who  failed  to  forecast  the  current  economic  recession?  Would  they  also  be  numbered  in  the  consensus  of    economists    who  have  never  foreseen  a  recession?  Are  they  also  the  same    economists    whoâve  never  seen  a  stimulus  bill  they  didnât  praise?  Are  they  also  the  same    economists    who  faithfully  always  promise  a  future  of  economic  hope,  lower  un-employment,  and  greater  riches?  Are  they  the  same    economists    who  can  foresee  the  beginning  of  economic  good  times  and  yet  never  do  foresee  the  beginning  of  economic  woes?  Are  these  the  same    economists    who  are  to  be  blamed  for  the  mantra  âhouse  prices  will  always  appreciateâ?  Are  these  the  same  economists  who  are  paid  to  forecast  good-news?  Are  these  the  same    economists    who  refuse  to  invest  their  wages  despite  their  prognostications  about  the  economy?  Are  these  the  same    economists    whose  powers  of  divination  are  measured  by  consumer  confidence?    Shall  I  continueâ¦?    BTW,  Obama  will  be  awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  for  economics  because  of  his  intention  to  save  not  only  the  US  economy  but  also  the  economy  of  the  World.[SEP]Nobody  has  a  crystal  ball.  We  all  understand  this.  Come  back  when  you  have  a  real  argument.  (And  no,  paranoid  ad  hominem  is  not  a  real  argument.)[SEP]Then  post  an  argument  that  is  worthy  of  being  logically  challenged.      Paranoid  Ad  Hominem?    Paranoia?  Bullshit,  you  only  hope  that  it  is  I  and  not  you  who  is  paranoid!    Are  you  unaware  that  only  some  ad  hominem  arguments  are  invalid?  Regardless  of  your  understanding  of  ad  hominem  arguments  and  when  and  why  they  are  valid  or  invalid,  I  will  inform  you  that  my  series  of  questions  is  implied  ad  hominem  but  is  certainly  not  fallacious.[SEP]You're  calling  me  paranoid?  I  don't  think  anybody's  out  to  get  me.  Last  I  checked  that's  the  opposite  of  paranoid.    I  don't  really  understand  your  contempt  for  economists  (or  rather,    economists  ).  Are  you  saying  members  of  the  profession  are  universally  untrustworthy  and  majorly  biased?  Let  me  guess:  The  only  person  who    really  gets  it    is  you.  Could  you  be  more  of  a  stereotypical  nutjob?    Anyway,  the  implications  of  your  questions  are  mostly  bogus.  Economists  do  at  times  predict  recessions.  They  don't  always  call  for  stimulus.  They  are  not  always  optimistic.  I  could  address  the  rest  of  your  questions,  but  frankly  I  feel  like  I'm  wasting  my  time  talking  to  you.    With  your  questions  you  repeatedly  ask  why  predictions  about  the  future  aren't  always  accurate,  as  if  the  answer  to  that  question  isn't  completely  obvious  --  no  one  can  predict  the  future,  we  can  only  make  educated  guesses.    Here,  since  you  know  everything,  how  about  offering  a  few  projections:  What's  unemployment  going  to  be  at  the  end  of  2010?  What's  GDP  going  to  be?  I  personally  am  no  where  near  arrogant  enough  to  think  I  can  answer  those  questions.  I'd  much  prefer  to  leave  them  to  those  who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  studying  them.[SEP]Before  I  post  a  refutation  of  your  latest  rebuttal,  are  you  willing  to  admit  before  hand  that  it  is  logically  possible  to  refute  your  argument?  If  you  are  not  willing  to  admit  the  possibility  of  seeing  your  argument  reduced  to  utter  non-sense  then  there  is  no  necessity  on  my  behalf  to  demonstrate  your  failure  to  refute.    When  you  refuse  to  recognize  your  straw-man  arguments  it  suggests  to  me  that  you  will  not  recognize  a  valid  refutation  of  your  view.    (Why  all  the  emotion?)[SEP]You  could  refute  my  argument  by  showing  either  that  I  am  wrong  in  my  assessment  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  or  showing  that  accepting  this  consensus  is  wrong  for  some  reason.    You  have  thus  far  attempted  (unsuccessfully)  to  do  the  latter.  But  you  haven't  provided  sufficient  evidence  (or  any  at  all  really).  Your  refusal  to  accept  the  opinion  of  qualified  experts  reflects  a  greater  anti-intellectual  trend  we're  seeing  in  American  politics  (particularly  among  conservatives).  In  effect,  you  are  advocating  ignorance.  And  judging  by  the  fact  that  several  people  have  upvoted  you,  you're  message  is  appealing.  The  fact  that  you  are  persuading  people  to  do  things  that  would  make  us  all  much  worse  off,  pisses  me  off  quite  deeply.[SEP]Ah,  so  you  want  to  go  to  the  beginning  of  our  correspondence?    Very  well!      Yes.  Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.      Firstly  you  didnât  distribute  your  subject,  economists.  And  in  response  I  rationally  supposed  that  you  meant    some    economists.  For  no  man  in  his  right  mind  would  make  the  error  of  supposing  that  all  economists  agree.  Furthermore,  I  even  granted  you  the  supposition  that  you  were  referring  to  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  concerning  employment  of  2010.      Secondly,  no  question  I  asked  you  remotely  hints  at  suggesting  that  all  economists  are  nit-wits.  I  repeatedly  asked  questions  that  implicated    only  some    economists,  and  never  could  it  be  rationally  asserted  that  I  implicated    all    economists.      If  you  disagree,  then  consider  the  following  example.    Economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  by  the  end  of  2010.    A  contrary  rebuttal:  Not  all  economists  expect  employment  to  be  back  the  end  of  2010.    Finally,  demonstrate  to  me  how  any  question  I  posed  in  my  original  post  implicated  all  economists;  for  you  certainly  responded  as  though  I  had.    Moving  onâ¦      You  refer  to  conservative  ideologues,  and  then  imply  they  are  not  rational  people.    All  US  economists  are  conservative  ideologues.  Why?  Because  all  US  economists  want  to  conserve  the  free-market  capitalism  of  the  US  which  they  believe  to  be  perfect  or  near  perfect.  Yet,  most  economists  supported  the  abandonment  of  free  market  principles  for  the  sake  of  capitalism  as  a  means  to  conserve  capitalism.  So,  who  is  rational,  the  economists  who  protected  their  ideological  view,  or  the  economists  who  supported  the  reign  of  free-market  principles.      Finally,  the  track  record  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  is  so  poor  I  canât  believe  any  person  would  use  the  opinion  of  the  same  as  a  premise  of  an  argument.  Albeit,  the  track  records  of  the  maverick  economists  are  more  in-tune  with  reality  though.        My  evidence:  Reality!  Why?  If  the  track  record  of  economists  was  as  worthy  of  policy  as  you  assert  then  the  economy  of  the  US  would  not  be  so  fucked  up  as  it  is  now.  Economic  forecasts  are  intended  to  preclude  the  mess  that  we  are  currently  struggling  with.    Shall  I  drive  that  point  further?    And  the  reason,  I  suppose,  that  my  post  was  up-voted  multiple  times  is  because,  believe  it  or  not,  I  spoke  of  that  which  they  too  are  witness.  And  like  me,  they  too  have  lived  long  enough  to  know  that  an  economist  predicts  so  far  into  the  future  that  most  men  are  not  likely  to  remember  the  previous  forecast  of  a  year  ago.  Yet,  if  there  are  some  who  do  remember,  I  assure  you  that  the  same  economists  will  provide  an  explanation  of  why  their  forecast  was  wrong.      Shall  I  continue  with  the  remainder  of  our  correspondence?    (Better  to  be  pissed  off  than  pissed  on.)      Oops,  I  almost  forgot!    Donât  ask  me  (implicitly)  to  divine  the  un-employment  rate  of  the  US  for  2010  as  an  evidence  of  why  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  is  wrong!      They  were  wrong  about  this  yearâs  rate  of  un-employment  and  I  have  no  reason  to  believe  they  can  foresee  next  yearâs  rate.	1
I  don't  think  so  because  he  said  he  will  change  the  United  States.  But  the  United  States  is  still  going  deeper  in  debt.  We  need  someone  who  can  stand  up  to  Economic  Crisis...  Not  someone  who  is  just  going  to  let  our  COUNTRY  go  deeper  in  debt.	1
Unless  Obama  shifts  more  to  the  center  I  see  no  way  other  than  national  emergency  that  he  will  remain  in  office.  My  support  could  have  easily  been  yes  and  the  same  argument  applies.  The  radical  Saul  Alinsky  type  blinders  the  President  has  are  becoming  manifest.  But  Barack  Obama  is  still  a  rock  star  who  no  doubt  has  more  tricks  up  his  sleeve.	1
where  i  live  only  the  black  people  like  obama  and  thats  because  hes  black  and  they  dont  have  any  idea  why  is  a  good  president.  if  you  ask  they  look  stupid  for  a  second  then  call  you  racist  because  apparently  they  think  that  we  made  a  judgment  about  him  being  black  and  that  has  absolutly  no  bearing  on  the  fact  that  he  has  never  done  anything  to  help  me  as  an  individual  and  all  the  other  things  that  are  other  debates  so  i  cant  bring  them  up  at  this  time	1
i  don't  think  he  should  because  he  still  is  trying  to  fight  the  war	1
No,  he  will  not  win  in  2012.  BECAUSE:    His  "change"  remarks,  never  came  true.  He's  done  nothing  to  help  this  country.  I  believe  he  told  everyone,  when  he's  president,  he'll  take  ALL  of  the  troops  out  of  the  Middle  East,  (which  I  enjoy  them  there..)  But  you  know  what  he  did?  He  sent  40,000  MORE.	1
Obama  didn't  do  all  the  tasks  that  he  promised  to  the  people  of  USA.  Therefore,  Obama  stinks,  and  yet  again,  Obama  won't  be  the  next  president  of  the  USA.  (I  think)	1

With  your  questions  you  repeatedly  ask  why  predictions  about  the  future  aren't  always  accurate,  as  if  the  answer  to  that  question  isn't  completely  obvious  --  no  one  can  predict  the  future,  we  can  only  make  educated  guesses.    Here,  since  you  know  everything,  how  about  offering  a  few  projections:  What's  unemployment  going  to  be  at  the  end  of  2010?  What's  GDP  going  to  be?  I  personally  am  no  where  near  arrogant  enough  to  think  I  can  answer  those  questions.  I'd  much  prefer  to  leave  them  to  those  who  have  dedicated  their  lives  to  studying  them.[SEP]Before  I  post  a  refutation  of  your  latest  rebuttal,  are  you  willing  to  admit  before  hand  that  it  is  logically  possible  to  refute  your  argument?  If  you  are  not  willing  to  admit  the  possibility  of  seeing  your  argument  reduced  to  utter  non-sense  then  there  is  no  necessity  on  my  behalf  to  demonstrate  your  failure  to  refute.    When  you  refuse  to  recognize  your  straw-man  arguments  it  suggests  to  me  that  you  will  not  recognize  a  valid  refutation  of  your  view.    (Why  all  the  emotion?)[SEP]You  could  refute  my  argument  by  showing  either  that  I  am  wrong  in  my  assessment  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  or  showing  that  accepting  this  consensus  is  wrong  for  some  reason.    You  have  thus  far  attempted  (unsuccessfully)  to  do  the  latter.  But  you  haven't  provided  sufficient  evidence  (or  any  at  all  really).  Your  refusal  to  accept  the  opinion  of  qualified  experts  reflects  a  greater  anti-intellectual  trend  we're  seeing  in  American  politics  (particularly  among  conservatives).  In  effect,  you  are  advocating  ignorance.  And  judging  by  the  fact  that  several  people  have  upvoted  you,  you're  message  is  appealing.  The  fact  that  you  are  persuading  people  to  do  things  that  would  make  us  all  much  worse  off,  pisses  me  off  quite  deeply.[SEP]Well  in  your  initial  argument  it  certainly  seems  as  though  you  are  attacking  economists  in  general.  Perhaps  you  could  try  being  more  clear  in  the  future.      All  US  economists  are  conservative  ideologues...      You  misuse  the  term  "conservative"  to  mean  "believer  in  free  markets".  This  is  misleading  because  liberals  also  believe  in  free  markets.  It's  only  a  question  of  the  degree  of  government  oversight  that  should  exist.  You  won't  find  many  purists  at  either  end  of  the  spectrum.      Finally,  the  track  record  of  the  consensus  opinion  of  economists  is  so  poor...the  track  records  of  the  maverick  economists  are  more  in-tune  with  reality  though.      Extraordinary  claims  require  extraordinary  evidence.  Thus  far  you  have  presented  none.    Yes,  it's  clear  that  most  economists  fucked  up  in  the  case  of  the  current  recession.  How  many  times  do  we  have  to  go  over  this?  The  future  is  hard  to  predict.  The  best  we  can  do  is  make  educated  guesses.  We  can't  predict  the  weather  with  100%  certainty,  but  that  doesn't  mean  we  shouldn't  try.	0

Redistribution  of  wealth  is  a  mechanism  of  all  economic  systems.  Socialism  uses  government  to  dictate  wages  and  taxes  to  prevent  excessive  wealth,  so  that  everyone  may  have  a  higher  standard  of  living  instead  of  just  the  wealthy.      How  does  that  matter?  Despite  what  you  consider  as  critical  utilities,  it  is  still  state  ownership?

It  is  one  of  the  fundamental  pillars  of  socialism,  that  government  owns  the  means  of  production  (business).      What  is  wrong  with  being  excessively  wealthy?  That  is  what  America  is.  Pursuing  self  interest.  Anything  else  is  socialism.      Wealth  translates  to  power.  The  point  of  democracy  is  is  to  give  everyone  an  equal  say  in  political  decisions  (one  person,  one  vote)  but  wealth  undermines  this  so  that  a  person  may  have  more  than  his  fair  share  of  influence  over  politics.      Well,  social  programs  are  characteristic  of  socialism.      But  not  a  singularly  defining  feature.      Actually  that  is  what  government  does  do.  It  takes  away  from  those  with  wealth  or  produce  and  gives  to  those  who  don't  produce  anything.      We  lived  in  a  society  which  treated  the  poor  and  underprivileged  as  though  it  was  their  own  faults.  It  resulted  in  short  life  spans,  16-hour  workdays,  complete  poverty,  pollution,  and  child  labour.    The  simple  answer  is  that  charity  and  compassion  produce  a  more  equal  society,  and  raise  the  standard  of  living  for  all,  so  that  we  need  not  have  tens  of  millions  of  starving  men  and  women  living  in  filth.	0

Saying  something  is  ok  for  people  to  do  doesn't  necessarily  mean  you  are  going  to  do  it  yourself.  You  make  it  seem  like  all  pro-choice  activists  hate  kids,  which  certainly  is      NOT      true!	1
We  should  give  him  another  opportunity.  I  saw  that  he  tried  to  work  his  best.  No  reason  we  don't  give  him  another  opportunity  ...  I  think  that.	0
Bush  had  several  years  to  fix  the  economy  as  well.  Did  he  fix  it?  Several  years  like  how  much?  Do  you  think  the  economy  is  something  you  can  fix  in  3  or  4  years?  If  that  was  the  case  then  we  wouldnt  have  need  a  president  when  President  Bush  could  have  done  it?    Saving  the  car  company  prevented  many  from  being  unemployed  and  also  prevented  a  strain  on  the  government  providing  unemployment  benefits  to  recipients.  We  need  taxpayers  money  to  help  maintain  the  economy  of  this  country.  The  war  in  Iraq  is  not  over  but  atleast  the  president  is  making  an  effort  to  tend  to  it.  People  make  it  seem  as  if  political  and  social  issues  are  something  you  can  fix  in  less  time  and  point  their  fingers  at  the  President  for  that.  If  other  people  can  do  it,  then  they  should  have  run  for  office  as  well.    Really?  Anyone  could  appoint  Supreme  Court  Justices?  That  all  political  parties  and  the  entire  nation  did  not  dispute  or  challenge?  Having  a  perception  that  something  is  far  more  easier  than  it  looks  is  just  a  myth  not  reality  in  a  world  like  the  one  we  are  living  in  today.[SEP]I  strongly  believe  that  Obama  should  be  given  a  second  term.  Since  Obama  has  been  in  power,  he  has  been  trying  his  best  to  make  certain  achievements.  We  all  know,  that  in  the  state  that  our  ecomony  is,  it  will  not  take  weeks  or  months  but  possibly  years  to  fix  or  embetter  and  for  this  reason,  we  should  give  him  another  chance  since  his  leadership  has  cultivated  many  presidential  achievements.  We  tend  to  blame  him  for  not  trying  his  best  to  embetter  the  economy  but  what  we  are  failing  to  understand  is  the  fact  that  this  is  his  first  term  in  office  and  the  economy  is  not  something  you  can  fix  in  a  second,  it  is  a  critical  aspect  that  requires  careful  thought,  planning,  analysis  and  actions  which  can  take  several  years.  It  is  also  through  President  Obama  and  his  supporters  that  the  health  care  bill,  legislation  to  curb  green  house  gases  and  improve  the  environment  passes,  preventing  a  second  great  depression  by  saving  three  large  car  manufacturers  from  going  out  of  business  and  which  would  have  possibly  leave  hundreds  or  thousands  without  jobs,  and  also  passed  the  largest  economic  stimulus  bill,  bringing  the  war  in  Iraq  to  an  end,  thus  saving  the  economy  a  lot  of  money  and  innocent  lives  from  being  taken,  nuclear  non-proliferation  movement,  repairing  our  image  abroad,  reversed  George  Bush's  ban  on  federal  funding  to  foreign  organizations  that  allows  abortion,  lifted  Bush's  ban  on  embryonic  stem  cell  research,  implementation  of  education  system  reform,  tobacco  regulation,  financial  industry  reformation,  appointing  two  Supreme  Court  Justices.  These  are  the  presidential  accomplishments  achieved  by  Obama  and  these  are  proof  that  the  president  is  determined  to  fullfill  his  promoses  he  had  first  made  to  the  nation.  Now,  it  is  our  turn  to  give  him  the  chance  he  need  to  do  so  and  give  him  some  more  time.[SEP]First  of  all,  he  has  had  several  years  to  fix  the  economy.  No  real  greenhouse  bills  have  been  passed,  they  have  accomplished  nothing  besides  increasing  spending.  Saving  the  car  companies  did  not  prevent  anything  and  he  basically  just  plugged  leaking  holes  in  corporations  that  will  never  work  due  to  the  extreme  wages  payed  to  workers.  The  war  in  Iraq  is  not  over.  Anyone  could  have  appointed  two  Justices  and  he  really  didn't  do  a  good  job  there  creating  the  biggest  controversy  in  the  history  of  the  Supreme  Court.  He  already  had  his  chance,  he  failed  at  basically  everything  he  said  he  would  do.  You  are  going  to  have  to  do  better  than  that  if  you  want  to  convince  anyone  he  did  a  "good  job"	0
Absolutely  not.He  is  not  doing  anything  ideologically  and  politically  new.	1
No  No  No...No  way,  no  how!  He  has  been  the  absolute  worst  President  ever...We  need  to  get  him  out  of  there!	1
We  should  have  a  Libertarian  president.  The  Libertarians  are  the  only  ones  who  actually  do  what  they  say  they  will  do.	1
Please  somebody  own  me  on  this....    My  answer  is  going  to  be  lengthy    I  have  a  few  problems  with  the  question.      First  of  all  the  question  is  untimely.  We  don't  know  who  his  competitors  will  be(  even  if  we  think  we  can  guess)      Second  of  all,  consequently  we  have  no  idea  what  the  competitors  ideas  or  arguments  will  be.      The  answer  is  neither  Yes  nor  No,  it's  "I  don't  know".  We  have  to  wait  till  the  evidence  is  in.      There  is  a  problem  with  this  as  well.  The  problem  is  that  most  political  reforms  don't  have  impact  till  years  after  they  have  been  approved.  This  makes  it  hard  to  evaluate  certain  decisions;  while  lending  reinforcement  to  the  saying  "Hindsight  is  20/20.      But  evolution  has  blessed  us  with  the  gift  of  playing  out  scenarios  in  our  heads  before  they  actually  happen.      Before  I  get  off  topic  let's  look  at  some  logical  facts.  Money  and  value  are  imaginary  ideas  that  we  give  to  certain  attributes  of  life.  Of  course  one  is  the  physical  manifestation  of  the  other.  Money  is  supposed  to  equal  value.  How  do  we  determine  value?  There  are  three  main  reasons  that  I  can  think  of.          1.  Rareness  (as  in  gold  or  diamonds)  These  are  just  elements  arranged  in  certain  patterns  that  we  give  value  to  mostly  for  aesthetic  appeal.  They  are  both  useful  in  other  ways,  but  this  is  not  normally  valued  over  aesthetic  appeal,  thus  diamonds  cost  fucking  a  lot.    2.  The  next  is  effort.  Money  is  meant  to  be  a  measure  of  effort  that  can  be  traded  amongst  others  for  their  effort.  I  think  this  is  a  good  thing,  but  at  the  same  time  it  makes  me  sad.  Large  hunks  of  metal  decorate  college  campuses  all  over  as  sculptures  that  could  have  been  put  to  use  as  cars  or  something  else,  yet  they  are  valued  more  for  they're  aesthetic  appeal  (see  example  1.).  Despite  this  waste,(and  many  others)  money  is  a  good  system.  It  measures  our  irrational  and  rational  feelings  towards  certain  things,  and  we  can  exchange  our  effort  for  what  we  value  with  a  neutral  measurement  of  currency.          3.  Originality.  This  may  be  a  new  invention  or  a  new  idea  that  we  have  our  evolution  given  foresight  to  value.  It  is  also  in  a  sense  rare  like  example  one.  It  may  also  require  a  great  deal  of  effort  like  example  two.  Thus  originality  is  valuable.      (a  quick  side  note:  don't  confuse  this  with  harmful  original  ideas  like  cannibalism  or  religion.  They  are  both  original  but  neither  is  truly  helpful,  if  not  completely  detrimental.)      What  am  I  getting  at?      MONEY  and  SUSTAINABILITY!    That  supposed  measure  of  effort  that  we  have  to  trade  for  the  things  we  want.  The  more  we  print  the  less  it's  worth.  (the  less  rare,  the  less  valuable;  i.e.  if  gold  was  everywhere  we  would  have  no  value  for  it...after  all  it's  everywhere)      Actually  then  maybe  it  would  be  valued  for  what  it's  actually  good  for...      The  point  is  that,  if  we  have  a  standard  for  the  measure  of  effort  to  pay  for  the  things  we  want,  and  need;  this  standard  cannot  be  allowed  to  change.  What  good  is  a  standard  for  measurement  if  it  can  be  changed  at  inconsistent  intervals?  This  leaves  no  measure.      If  Obama  is  willing  to  stop  changing  the  standard  of  effort,  i.e.  stop  printing  money.  Then  yes  I  would  be  willing  to  give  him  a  second  term,  however  this  seems  unlikely.      He  seems  to  want  to  use  a  scalpel  because  he  doesn't  have  the  balls  to  use  an  axe  when  needed.  He  can  print  more  money  and  the  standard  will  change  in  amounts  of  numbers,  but  THE  EFFORT  DOES  NOT  CHANGE!  The  effort  will  remain  the  same  or  most  likely  grow  stronger  regardless,  if  not  because  of,  the  variable  change  in  the  measure  of  effort.  i.e.  speculation  in  the  trading  of  currency  (measure  of  effort)  on  the  stock  market.  As  well  as  deep  questioning  about  the  worth  of  everything.  When  a  standard  changes,  all  that  were  measured  by  that  standard  must  be  re-evaluated.      Once  again  I  say  the  answer  to  the  question  is  a  matter  of  how  he  handles  the  standard  of  money  and  how  sustainable  it  stays  as  a  measure  of  effort;  but  I  remain  skeptical...    I  will  elaborate  further  if  I  even  get  a  reply  to  this  argument.	1

I  will  elaborate  further  if  I  even  get  a  reply  to  this  argument.[SEP]I  hope  you  don't  mind,  but  I'd  like  to  follow-up  your  lengthy  argument  with  a  lengthy  redress.    While  it  is  true  that  we  do  not  know  who  will  face-off  against  Pres.  Obama,  we  can  have  a  pretty  good  idea.  Any  of  the  republican  candidates  mentioned  so  far,  Palin,  Pawlenty,  Huckabee,  are  more  right  than  Bush  or  Obama,  but  they  have  managed  to  build  small  contingents  of  vehement  supporters.  Some  of  the  possible  candidates  still  question  Pres.  Obama's  citizenship.  That  is  simply  ignorance.  I  would  hate  to  see  the  country  fall  back  into  the  lap  of  an  embarrassingly  inept  executive.    Now  I  cannot  argue  that  Pres.  Obama  is  much  different  than  the  last  president.  Mr.  Bush  should  not  be  defended  for  he  was  a  reckless  spender  (Medicaid,  Bail  out),  drove  us  into  two  extended  wars,  led  us  into  massive  debt,  was  utterly  divisive,  and  spoke  much  more  like  Ford  than  Lincoln  or  Clinton  for  that  matter.  Has  Obama  (stimulus  package,  health  care,  war  in  Libya)  done  much  to  differentiate  himself  from  his  predecessor?  I  can't  say  that  he  has.  However,  we  would  at  least  have  the  possibility  of  change  with  a  democrat  in  office.  Republicans  are  called  conservatives  for  a  reason.      What  our  government  needs  to  do  is  tackle  the  core  issues  that  no  one  is  willing  to  address:  the  poverty  gap  and  incarceration  rates.  I'll  briefly  address  part  of  the  poverty  gap  issue  by  looking  at  the  top  money  earners  in  our  country.          The  extension  of  the  Bush  tax  cuts  for  the  wealthy,  enacted  by  a  Democratic-controlled  Congress  in  December  with  the  approval  of  the  Obama  administration,  pumps  $700  billion  over  the  next  ten  years  into  the  pockets  of  the  rich.  Reclaiming  two  years  of  that  tax  windfall  would  eliminate  all  of  the  state  budget  deficits  combined.    Total  compensation  at  Wall  Street  banks  and  securities  firms  last  year  hit  a  record  $135  billion,  according  to  an  analysis  by  the  Wall  Street  Journal,  on  all-time-high  revenue  of  $417  billion.  The  recipients  of  the  Wall  Street  bailout  could  bail  out  the  states  out  of  their  own  pockets.    The  400  richest  individuals  in  the  United  States  dispose  of  a  staggering  $1.37  trillion  in  assets,  an  average  of  nearly  $3.5  billion  apiece.  A  levy  of  10  percent  on  the  resources  of  these  billionaires  would  also  erase  the  deficits  of  all  50  states.    US  corporations  are  currently  sitting  on  $2  trillion  in  cash,  refusing  to  hire  workers  despite  collecting  tax  cuts  that  are  supposed  to  be  incentives  to  do  so.  A  levy  of  10  percent  on  that  idle  cash  would  provide  enough  money  to  eliminate  not  only  the  deficits  of  the  states,  but  the  deficits  of  all  cities  and  local  governments  too,  as  well  as  preserving  the  jobs  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  public  employees.    Hedge  funds  assets  rose  to  $1.92  trillion  in  2010,  the  highest  ever,  up  from  $1.18  trillion  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Given  a  standard  earnings  formula  of  2  percent  of  total  assets  plus  20  percent  of  the  increase,  hedge  fund  bosses  stood  to  collect  roughly  $186  billion  in  personal  income.  An  80  percent  tax  on  that  incomeâless  than  the  percentage  rate  on  multimillionaires  levied  under  the  Eisenhower  administrationâwould  produce  more  than  enough  revenue  to  put  all  50  states  in  the  black.  (It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  top  hedge  fund  manager,  John  Paulson,  had  a  personal  net  profit  of  more  than  $5  billion  in  2010,  while  more  than  a  dozen  hedge  fund  bosses  had  personal  incomes  above  $2  billion  and  many  more  took  in  over  $1  billion).    This  is  a  small  portion  of  the  discrepancies.  I  haven't  mentioned  the  top  paid  CEOs  of  the  big  six  health  insurance  providers.  For  that  information  I  suggest  looking  at  the  Sick  for  Profit  website.      That's  why  I  think  we  should  stick  with  Obama  no  matter  who  opposes  him,  unless  it's  someone  like  Russ  Feingold  or  Bernie  Sanders.  Then  I'd  go  with  Sanders.	0
Oh  Yea,  there  is  something  obvious  that  I  forgot  in  my  original  point,  or  points:          Borrowing  money.  Borrowing  money  from  people  who  print  money  and  devalue  their  currency  is  just  as  bad  a  printing  money.  Actually  it's  worse,  it'  puts  you  in  debt  the  your  borrowers  i.e.  China.  Only  if  every  country  is  free  of  debt  to  another  will  they  truly  be  free.      Just  like  there  are  casualties  of  ware  over  territory,security,  goods  and  other  things,  now  there  is  a  different  war  over  debt  that  may  require  casualties  in  the  name  of  true  freedom.  Though  these  will  not  be  as  obvious  as  soldiers  on  the  battlefeild.  They  will  be  the  ones  who  die  due  to  cuts  in  medical  programs  and  welfare  programs.  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  social  security  are  the  biggest  share  of  our  debt  and  we  keep  borrowing  money  from  countries  with  no  working  standards  or  conditions  to  avoid  the  inevitable.  The  pay  out  that  will  leave  us  all  broke.  When  the  elderly  outnumber  the  people  working  to  support  them.  Or  better  their  bills  outnumber  the  wages  of  those  who  support  them.      Freedom  comes  at  a  cost.  Only  those  who  are  willing  to  make  the  sacrifices  will  get  it.      So  far  I  see  Obama  is  willing  to  make  some  sacrifices,  but  not  the  tough  ones.  Tough  ones  are  required  to  climb  out  of  the  hole  which  we  have  dug.  The  borrowing  has  to  stop.  The  printing  has  to  stop.  Or  we  will  never  get  out.      I'm  sorry  that's  just  what  logic  dictates.  Once  again  I  ask...  somebody  own  me  on  this...  I  want  your  best  arguments  seriously....	1
His  war  with  Libya  is  what  has  damaged  his  standing  in  Africa  for  good!	1
Obama,  in  my  opinion,  should  have  never  been  elected.  He  was  only  voted  in  because  of  the  hype  that  the  media  and  people  created  around  him.  He  hasn't  done  anything  for  our  country  and  if  he  says  that  next  term  he  will,  it's  just  another  lie.  I  don't  believe  any  of  it.	1

Ron  Paul,  because  steam-punk  dystopian  USA  would  be  so  much  more  fun,  not  really.      I  can't  vote  but  oh  well  XD    Obama  has  kept  many  of  his  promises  and  working  on  others:        http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/                                                                                promises/obameter/        Besides,  that,  I  mean,  being  the  way  I  am,  I  would  fight  for  the  man  who  can  get  the  job  done  without  pushing  too  much  to  the  economic  extreme.  Obama  is  the  man  I  know  I  could  trust  on  that  issue.  Although  we  all  know  the  stimulus  was  too  small  and  that  the  marginal  disutility  of  labour  right  now  is  less  than  desirable  because  of  shrinking  pay  checks,  which  is  counter  productive  in  a  liquidity  trap.    That  is  my  only  qualm,  that  he  failed  to  push  through  a  more  ambitious  plan  to  capitalize  on  the  deflation  of  the  dollar  and  the  economic  recession  to  modernize  many  of  America's  public  works,  water,  roads  and  such.  Because,  really,  for  the  last  20  or  so  years  most  haven't  been  upgraded  or  anything.    That  being  what  it  is,  the  multiplier  effect  was  much  too  small  to  make  up  the  fall  in  aggregate  demand  from  the  collapse.	0

We  should  give  him  another  opportunity.  I  saw  that  he  tried  to  work  his  best.  No  reason  we  don't  give  him  another  opportunity  ...  I  think  that.[SEP]I  wouldnt  necessarily  say  that  Obama  isnt  exactly  trying  his  hardest  or  not  doing  anything  at  all,  I  just  personally  dont  believe  that  the  direction  that  hes  taking  is  a  very  good  one  or  beneficial  one.  He  has  more  or  less  driven  himself  into  a  hole  of  favor  debt,  one  that  he  pays  back  in  biased  legislature,  and  hes  part  of  the  Democratic  Political  party  which  is  essentially  using  him,  regardless  of  what  he  thinks.  Under  such,  I  believe  that  Both  a  new  candidate  is  required,  preferably  one  from  an  independent  party  for  some  fresh  air  and  far  less  political  agenda,  and  eventually  a  massive  political  overhaul  of  parties  and  lobbying.  But  since  were  talking  about  Obama  specifically,  youve  got  youre  answer.  No,  its  not  a  good  idea.  No,  we  dont  have  a  good  candidate  replacement,  but  still  no,  its  not  a  good  idea.	1

No  one  has  a  chance  if  elections  were  today.

For  passing  a  huge  stimulus  bill  that  fact  checkers  agree  (check  factcheck.org)  helped  us  from  going  into  a  depression,  as  well  as  the  bank  bailout  and  auto  industry  bailout  that,  left  unaddressed,  could  have  cost  the  economy  even  more  jobs,  I  will  vote  for  him  again.    For  being  a  leader  in  the  midst  of  criticism  from  both  sides  and  having  the  audacity  to  believe  that  millions  more  Americans  deserve  health  care  as  opposed  to  the  Republican  plan  of  not  giving  those  millions  of  Americans  health  care,  I  will  vote  for  him  again.    For  standing  up  for  gay  rights  and  leading  the  fight  against  the  discriminatory  "Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell"  policy  that  prevents  patriotic  Americans  from  serving  their  country  for  something  as  silly  as  sexual  preference,  I  will  vote  for  him  again.    For  negotiating  the  START  treaty  and  seeing  it  passed  in  a  bipartisan  way,  I  will  vote  for  him  again.    And  for  the  times  when  his  heart  was  in  the  right  place  and  he  tried  to  do  but  could  not  thanks  to  Republican  and  Blue  Dog  opposition  in  Congress  (a  public  option,  reducing  the  deficit  by  not  granting  tax  cuts  to  the  richest  Americans,  the  DREAM  act),  I  will  vote  for  him  again.

He  is  actually  trying,  the  only  flaw  is  that  we  the  people  tend  to  expect  a  lot  out  of  our  leaders,  as  many  did  when  Obama  was  elected.

It's  either  Obama  or  a  republican.  It's  a  true  dilemma  that  is  solved  by  remembering  what  a  lousy  president  GW  Bush  was.  We  don't  need  another  republican  touting  trickle  down  economics  (voodoo  economics).  Although  Obama  and  Bush  have  more  in  common  than  either  democrats  or  republicans  want  to  admit,  I'll  still  pick  Obama  for  the  reason  that  democrats  seem  to  be  less  destructive  than  republicans.  In  general,  both  dems  and  reps  will  screw  the  working  class  but  the  dems  at  least  apologize.	0
Obama  has  been  helping  and  taken  control  of  a  lot  of  important  things  that  would  have  turned  out  badly.  In  his  second  term,  if  he  gets  it,  he  will  be  able  to  adress  more  and  more  problems.	0

I  think  that  no  President  has  managed  to  complete  everything  that  they  have  planned  in  a  single  term,  or  even  in  two  terms.  Obama  has  done  well  for  a  first  term.  I  think  that  if  we  can  give  someone  like  Bush  two  terms  to  produce  such  a  sh*t  storm,  it  is  imperative  to  give  Obama  the  same  amount  of  time  to  try  to  resolve  SOME  of  the  issues.	0

If  someone  better  runs  I  am  completely  for  it.  Obama  was  only  elected  due  to  all  the  media  hype  and  "young  voters"  who  no  nothing  about  politics  to  being  with.  If  he  was  doing  all  that  he  could,  why  is  it  that  they  elected  a  democrat  (Obama)  but  fought  back  with  republicans  this  past  election  day?  Nope  I'm  not  up  for  all  this  Obama  care  crap.  Save  it!  I  think  their  is  bigger  fish  to  fry  and  more  things  to  worry  about  than  our  health  care  system.	1

Absolutely  not!  He  has  tried  to  do  what  he  said,  but  if  you  rate  him  based  on  a  scorecard  of  how  well  he  is  implementing  change,  I  would  say  he  is  failing.	1

Ron  Paul[SEP]"Sure,  he  should  be  granted  credit  for  instituting  progress  towards  socialism."    What  is  wrong  with  a  de-centralized  planned  economy?  It  is  not  taking  away  your  democracy.  Rather,  it  encourages  more  democracy.    In  our  current  capitalist  societies,  5%  of  the  population  controls  95%  of  the  nations  wealth.  A  nation  that  disproportionate  sounds  more  like  a  caste  system,  not  a  democracy    A  de-centralised  planned  economy  is  one  where  ownership  of  enterprises  is  accomplished  through  various  forms  of  worker  cooperatives;  planning  of  production  is  done  from  the  bottom  up  by  local  worker  councils  in  a  democratic  manner    In  other  words,  giving  people  MORE  freedom.    Do  you  hate  freedom?    or  just  the  word  'socialist'?    "Sure,  to  a  certain  degree.  Only  because  of  bad  government  policy."    Yes,  but  not  HIS  bad  government  policies.  He  had  to  clean  out  the  monkey's  cage.    "What  was  so  bad  about  the  last  eight  years  besides  the  war?"

He  never  said  Change  was  going  to  be  for  the  better."    it  was  implied.  There  is  absolutely  no  way  you  can  argue  that  he  is  actively  trying  to  change  things  for  the  worse.

I  am  ambivalent  about  his  economic  policies  but  I  do  not  believe  a  Republican  President  would  have  done  much  different,  because  only  Libertarians  support  doing  nothing  as  massive  businesses  go  bankrupt  and  take  their  employees  and  investors  with  them.    His  diplomacy  might  be  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  I  do  not  know  however.  It  seems  to  me  that  a  majority  of  these  Islamic  States  would  want  to  work  with  us  in  eliminating  terrorism  since  they  are  have  their  own  share  of  sectarian  bombings,  but  the  religious  mindset  is  an  odd  one.

We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.[SEP]We  just  entered  and  exited  a  great  worldwide  recession  over  a  period  of  three  years,  in  which  Obama  spent  almost  a  trillion  in  economic  stimulus.      Which  hasn't  done  anything  except  waste  1  trillion  dollars  on  borrowed  money.    Proof:  9.7%  unemployment  in  America.      Plus,  we  were  in  war,  which  is  always  expensive.      Which  is  a  waste.  Money  wasted  due  to  two  warmongers,  Bush  and  Obama.      One  other  thing,  prove  for  me  that  governments  cannot  create  wealth.      Creating  jobs  and  wealth  is  interchangeably  linked  because  if  jobs  are  created  by  producing  an  new  good  or  service,  then  wealth  is  created,  so  in  a  capitalist  economy,  government  has  no  assets  to  produce  anything  without  taxation  that  is  taken  out  of  the  private  sector,  government  doesn't  create  jobs  and  wealth,  it  merely  transfers  jobs  and  wealth  from  private  to  public.      Government  spending  has  three  sources  of  misrepresented  stimulus.    1.  Taxation  doesn't  create  new  jobs  or  wealth  because  it  only  transfers  wealth  from  one  who  creates  new  wealth.  Sure,  government  employees  received  incomes,  but  it  is  at  the  expense  of  those  who  produce.  Government  employees  don't  produce  anything  new,  they  only  take  from  the  general  public.    2.  Government  borrowing  is  just  as  inadequate  as  taxation,  yet  at  least  in  taxation,  it  is  paid.  It  reduces  investment  in  capital,  labor  and  land.  Consequently,  this  translates  into  fewer  new  factories,  machines,  and  homes  being  built.  Not  only  does  this  decrease  in  private  investment  slow  economic  growth,  it  results  in  additional  unemployment  in  these  industries.  Government  borrowing  has  the  illusion  of  wealth.    3.  The  worst  source  of  additional  government  spending  is  creating  new  money  either  by  simply  printing  more  money  or  lower  interest  rates.  Thus,  this  monetary  event  always  results  in  inflation  by  eroding  the  value  of  the  currency,  and  consequently,  it  started  the  Great  Depression.    In  addition,    "But  though  government  can  consume  wealth  and  redistribute  wealth,  it  can't  create  wealth.  And  unless  wealth  is  created,  there  is  nothing  to  consume  or  redistribute.  That's  why  --  even  when  government  is  doing  something  we  all  agree  must  be  done  or  most  of  us  want  to  have  it  do  --  government  is  a  parasite.  All  it  has  is  what  it  takes  from  the  producers  of  wealth...  For  the  economy  to  grow,  government  must  shrink."    Wealth  1      "In  a  capitalistic  economy,  labor  and  capital  freely  flows  to  the  most  productive  enterprises  precisely  because  theyâre  the  most  profitable.  All  government  can  do  is  inefficiently  redistribute  wealth  that  the  private  sector  creates."  Wealth  2      "But  it  is  a  fallacy  of  the  Keynesian  legacy  that  government  can  reduce  unemployment  by  priming  the  pump  with  spending  programs.  Government  needs  to  reduce  spending  and  taxes  in  order  to  leave  income  in  the  hands  of  individuals  who  earned  it  and  who  can  spend  it  much  more  efficiently  than  the  government  can."    Jobs  1      "Governments  have  only  three  ways  of  paying  employees  â  taxes,  borrowing  and  printing  money.  Each  of  those  reduces  income  and  wealth  among  those  paying  taxes,  servicing  debts  or  stuck  with  shrinking  greenbacks.  In  short,  governments  can't  "create  jobs."  Adding  government  jobs  is  never  a  net  addition  to  employment  opportunities,  because  it  means  a  heavier  burden  on  private  employers  and  employees.  "    Jobs  2      "It  overlooks  the  fact  that,  in  the  real  world,  government  canât  inject  money  into  the  economy  without  first  taking  money  out  of  the  economy.  More  specifically,  the  theory  only  looks  at  one-half  of  the  equation  â  the  part  where  government  puts  money  in  the  economyâs  right  pocket.  But  where  does  the  government  get  that  money?  It  borrows  it,  which  means  it  comes  out  of  the  economyâs  left  pocket.  There  is  no  increase  in  what  Keynesians  refer  to  as  aggregate  demand.  Keynesianism  doesnât  boost  national  income,  it  merely  redistributes  it."    Jobs  3      "When  the  government  attempts  to  create  a  job,  all  of  these  natural  forces  are  removed.  The  market  has  produced  no  demand  for  the  government-created  job.  In  other  words,  no  buyer  has  voluntarily  agreed  to  purchase  those  services,  because  to  do  so  under  current  market  conditions  would  be  unprofitable.  Were  it  profitable  to  hire  someone  to  do  the  government-created  job,  an  employer  would  have  done  so  voluntarily.  So,  the  government  steps  in  and  forces  the  taxpayer  to  purchase  those  services  against  his  will.  In  additional  to  violating  the  taxpayerâs  rights,  the  entire  coordination  that  existed  between  employer,  employee,  and  consumer  is  disrupted.  "    Jobs  4      To  illustrate  further,  this  is  what  government  does  to  destroy  wealth  or  job  creation  because  it  thinks  it  can  create  jobs  and  wealth.    WATCH  VIDEO        I  agree  (more  or  less)  with  the  healthcare  reforms,  his  overturning  of  policies  involving  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  the  "Matthew  Shepard  and  James  Byrd,  Jr.  Hate  Crimes  Prevention  Act",  "Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal  Act  of  2010"  and  his  ending  of  the  War  in  Iraq.      More  insurance  isn't  going  to  contain  costs  in  premiums  and  deductibles.  It  is  only  going  be  more  expensive.  When  you  buy  a  car,  you  pay  for  what  you  get.  If  you  want  a  Mercedes  E-Class,  you  have  to  pay  for  it  compared  to  a  Ford  Fiesta.  More  coverage  =  more  money.  This  is  what  the  bill  does,  just  more  insurance.    As  for  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  it  should  be  left  to  private  research.  Polo's  cure  was  invented  by  a  private  scientist,  not  government,  where  in  the  goodness  of  his  heart,  he  donated  it  without  patents  for  profit.    As  for  Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal,  we  will  see  how  effective  it  is  in  the  years  to  come.  One  way  or  another,  I  don't  care.  Military  recruitment  should  be  non  compulsive  and  open  to  anyone  regardless.  Why  does  the  government  need  to  even  know  your  sexual  orientation?  WHY  RED  TAPE!!  That  is  irrelevant  to  a  solider.      because  only  Libertarians  support  doing  nothing  as  massive  businesses  go  bankrupt  and  take  their  employees  and  investors  with  them.      Again,  you  are  an  odd  creature,  you  absolutely  chastise  business  because  it  is  inherently  corrupt  and  greedy,  but  get  all  sympathetic  for  big  business  when  they  go  bankrupt  because  of  bad  management.  Where  is  your  sympathy  for  when  small  bushiness  goes  out  of  business?  There  is  none  because  that  is  business.  Bad  management  equals  failure,  and  you  support  it.  No  wonder  you  like  government.  You  enjoy  bad  management.      Not  all  of  these  were  related  to  Bush  however.      Doesn't  matter.  It  was  still  failure  of  government.  It  is  central  planning  at  its  finest.  A  series  of  failures,  but  no  sees  that.  It  is  government  attempting  to  control  to  many  things,  and  it  fails.      How  about  some  new  blood  that  understands  the  issues  of  today?  We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.      Looks  like  someone  has  a  conspiracy,  someone  who  doesn't  engage  in  conspiracies.    That  controversy  is  as  accurate  as  the  Obama  not  born  in  America.	1

Not  only  does  this  decrease  in  private  investment  slow  economic  growth,  it  results  in  additional  unemployment  in  these  industries.  Government  borrowing  has  the  illusion  of  wealth.    3.  The  worst  source  of  additional  government  spending  is  creating  new  money  either  by  simply  printing  more  money  or  lower  interest  rates.  Thus,  this  monetary  event  always  results  in  inflation  by  eroding  the  value  of  the  currency,  and  consequently,  it  started  the  Great  Depression.    In  addition,    "But  though  government  can  consume  wealth  and  redistribute  wealth,  it  can't  create  wealth.  And  unless  wealth  is  created,  there  is  nothing  to  consume  or  redistribute.  That's  why  --  even  when  government  is  doing  something  we  all  agree  must  be  done  or  most  of  us  want  to  have  it  do  --  government  is  a  parasite.  All  it  has  is  what  it  takes  from  the  producers  of  wealth...  For  the  economy  to  grow,  government  must  shrink."    Wealth  1      "In  a  capitalistic  economy,  labor  and  capital  freely  flows  to  the  most  productive  enterprises  precisely  because  theyâre  the  most  profitable.  All  government  can  do  is  inefficiently  redistribute  wealth  that  the  private  sector  creates."  Wealth  2      "But  it  is  a  fallacy  of  the  Keynesian  legacy  that  government  can  reduce  unemployment  by  priming  the  pump  with  spending  programs.  Government  needs  to  reduce  spending  and  taxes  in  order  to  leave  income  in  the  hands  of  individuals  who  earned  it  and  who  can  spend  it  much  more  efficiently  than  the  government  can."    Jobs  1      "Governments  have  only  three  ways  of  paying  employees  â  taxes,  borrowing  and  printing  money.  Each  of  those  reduces  income  and  wealth  among  those  paying  taxes,  servicing  debts  or  stuck  with  shrinking  greenbacks.  In  short,  governments  can't  "create  jobs."  Adding  government  jobs  is  never  a  net  addition  to  employment  opportunities,  because  it  means  a  heavier  burden  on  private  employers  and  employees.  "    Jobs  2      "It  overlooks  the  fact  that,  in  the  real  world,  government  canât  inject  money  into  the  economy  without  first  taking  money  out  of  the  economy.  More  specifically,  the  theory  only  looks  at  one-half  of  the  equation  â  the  part  where  government  puts  money  in  the  economyâs  right  pocket.  But  where  does  the  government  get  that  money?  It  borrows  it,  which  means  it  comes  out  of  the  economyâs  left  pocket.  There  is  no  increase  in  what  Keynesians  refer  to  as  aggregate  demand.  Keynesianism  doesnât  boost  national  income,  it  merely  redistributes  it."    Jobs  3      "When  the  government  attempts  to  create  a  job,  all  of  these  natural  forces  are  removed.  The  market  has  produced  no  demand  for  the  government-created  job.  In  other  words,  no  buyer  has  voluntarily  agreed  to  purchase  those  services,  because  to  do  so  under  current  market  conditions  would  be  unprofitable.  Were  it  profitable  to  hire  someone  to  do  the  government-created  job,  an  employer  would  have  done  so  voluntarily.  So,  the  government  steps  in  and  forces  the  taxpayer  to  purchase  those  services  against  his  will.  In  additional  to  violating  the  taxpayerâs  rights,  the  entire  coordination  that  existed  between  employer,  employee,  and  consumer  is  disrupted.  "    Jobs  4      To  illustrate  further,  this  is  what  government  does  to  destroy  wealth  or  job  creation  because  it  thinks  it  can  create  jobs  and  wealth.    WATCH  VIDEO        I  agree  (more  or  less)  with  the  healthcare  reforms,  his  overturning  of  policies  involving  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  the  "Matthew  Shepard  and  James  Byrd,  Jr.  Hate  Crimes  Prevention  Act",  "Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal  Act  of  2010"  and  his  ending  of  the  War  in  Iraq.      More  insurance  isn't  going  to  contain  costs  in  premiums  and  deductibles.  It  is  only  going  be  more  expensive.  When  you  buy  a  car,  you  pay  for  what  you  get.  If  you  want  a  Mercedes  E-Class,  you  have  to  pay  for  it  compared  to  a  Ford  Fiesta.  More  coverage  =  more  money.  This  is  what  the  bill  does,  just  more  insurance.    As  for  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  it  should  be  left  to  private  research.  Polo's  cure  was  invented  by  a  private  scientist,  not  government,  where  in  the  goodness  of  his  heart,  he  donated  it  without  patents  for  profit.    As  for  Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal,  we  will  see  how  effective  it  is  in  the  years  to  come.  One  way  or  another,  I  don't  care.  Military  recruitment  should  be  non  compulsive  and  open  to  anyone  regardless.  Why  does  the  government  need  to  even  know  your  sexual  orientation?  WHY  RED  TAPE!!  That  is  irrelevant  to  a  solider.      because  only  Libertarians  support  doing  nothing  as  massive  businesses  go  bankrupt  and  take  their  employees  and  investors  with  them.      Again,  you  are  an  odd  creature,  you  absolutely  chastise  business  because  it  is  inherently  corrupt  and  greedy,  but  get  all  sympathetic  for  big  business  when  they  go  bankrupt  because  of  bad  management.  Where  is  your  sympathy  for  when  small  bushiness  goes  out  of  business?  There  is  none  because  that  is  business.  Bad  management  equals  failure,  and  you  support  it.  No  wonder  you  like  government.  You  enjoy  bad  management.      Not  all  of  these  were  related  to  Bush  however.      Doesn't  matter.  It  was  still  failure  of  government.  It  is  central  planning  at  its  finest.  A  series  of  failures,  but  no  sees  that.  It  is  government  attempting  to  control  to  many  things,  and  it  fails.      How  about  some  new  blood  that  understands  the  issues  of  today?  We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.      Looks  like  someone  has  a  conspiracy,  someone  who  doesn't  engage  in  conspiracies.    That  controversy  is  as  accurate  as  the  Obama  not  born  in  America.[SEP]Which  hasn't  done  anything  except  waste  1  trillion  dollars  on  borrowed  money.    Proof:  9.7%  unemployment  in  America.      It's  debatable.  I  prefer  not  to  get  into  it  because  it  will  be  a  few  years  before  we  can  gauge  its  effectiveness  without  polemics.      Which  is  a  waste.  Money  wasted  due  to  two  warmongers,  Bush  and  Obama.      I  don't  think  so.  While  I  would  have  preferred  Saudi  Arabia  to  Iraq,  it  still  gives  us  a  possible  ally  in  the  middle  east  (it's  an  Islamic  State  however,  so  that  might  be  in  vain).  It  also  rooted  out  a  number  of  terrorist  factions  in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq.    The  big  disappointment  is  that  we  allowed  them  to  make  the  state  a  theocracy.  This  means  that  there  is  a  strong  possibility  that  sectarianism  will  continue  in  Iraq  long  after  our  forces  leave,  and  that  the  government  will  ultimately  make  an  enemy  of  us.      Creating  jobs  and  wealth  is  interchangeably  linked  because  if  jobs  are  created  by  producing  an  new  good  or  service,  then  wealth  is  created,  so  in  a  capitalist  economy,  government  has  no  assets  to  produce  anything  without  taxation  that  is  taken  out  of  the  private  sector,  government  doesn't  create  jobs  and  wealth,  it  merely  transfers  jobs  and  wealth  from  private  to  public.        I  think  you  contradicted  yourself.  If  the  creation  of  jobs  is  interchangeable  with  the  creation  of  wealth,  then  it  must  follow  that  the  government  creates  jobs  (and  wealth)  whenever  it  creates  new  organisations  (like  NASA,  the  FBI,  Military  branches,  etc.).    Those  are  not  transferred  jobs  because  there  was  never  a  private  sector  equivalent.      1.  Taxation  doesn't  create  new  jobs  or  wealth  because  it  only  transfers  wealth  from  one  who  creates  new  wealth.  Sure,  government  employees  received  incomes,  but  it  is  at  the  expense  of  those  who  produce.  Government  employees  don't  produce  anything  new,  they  only  take  from  the  general  public.      They  produce  technologies  and  monuments  which  are  too  expensive  for  corporations  to  create.  Examples  being  space  exploration  and  all  of  our  military  technology.  Taxation  takes  surplus  wealth  from  producers  and  uses  it  to  fund  the  creation  of  these  things.      3.  The  worst  source  of  additional  government  spending  is  creating  new  money  either  by  simply  printing  more  money  or  lower  interest  rates.  Thus,  this  monetary  event  always  results  in  inflation  by  eroding  the  value  of  the  currency,  and  consequently,  it  started  the  Great  Depression.      Right.  Except  for  the  last  point.  The  great  depression  was  caused  by  insider  trading  and  corruption  of  the  stock  market.      "In  a  capitalistic  economy,  labor  and  capital  freely  flows  to  the  most  productive  enterprises  precisely  because  theyâre  the  most  profitable.

Jobs  1      If  the  market  works  like  Natural  Selection,  and  businesses  behave  like  animals,  then  Keynesian  policy  would  merely  be  that  which  applies  artificial  pressure  to  the  evolution  of  business.  If  this  is  true,  then  it  follows  that  the  market's  behaviours  can  be  changed  to  correct  social  problems  like  unemployment.

What  I  would  be  interested  in  hearing  is  how  a  tax  is  different  from  a  sale,  practically  speaking.  I'm  not  interested  in  how  you're  compelled  to  pay  tax,  because  force  is  irrelevant  to  the  immediate  equation,  which  is  the  creation  of  jobs  (and  wealth)  through  the  trading  of  money.      "When  the  government  attempts  to  create  a  job,  all  of  these  natural  forces  are  removed.  The  market  has  produced  no  demand  for  the  government-created  job.

In  the  discussion  about  economics,  what  matters  is  that  money  changes  hands.      To  illustrate  further,  this  is  what  government  does  to  destroy  wealth  or  job  creation  because  it  thinks  it  can  create  jobs  and  wealth.

Government-funded  research  exists  because  most  research  is  costly  and  unprofitable  to  the  private  market.  It  is  costly  in  the  case  of  medicine  because  of  laws  imposed  due  to  our  lessons  learned  with  free  market  medicine  (remember  Radithor  and  Snake  Oil?)  and  due  to  the  lack  of  ethics  in  general  which  existed  (the  Smallpox  vaccine  was  tested  by  picking  a  vagrant  child  off  the  street  and  injecting  him  with  the  virus,  for  example).  Polio's  researchers  and  early  efforts  to  make  a  vaccine  used  a  similar  lack  of  ethics:  3000  children  were  injected  with  an  unsuccessful  mixture  which  caused  allergic  reactions  in  some  of  them.    In  other  words:  government  takes  over  where  private  industry  would  fail  or  be  less  successful.    As  to  the  stem  cells:  you  can  thank  Bush  for  regulating  stem  cells  in  the  first  place.  Obama  rescinded  his  laws.

It  seems  to  me  that  a  majority  of  these  Islamic  States  would  want  to  work  with  us  in  eliminating  terrorism  since  they  are  have  their  own  share  of  sectarian  bombings,  but  the  religious  mindset  is  an  odd  one.      What  you  pointed  out  are  failures  of  government  policy.  9/11=Bad  Intelligence,  Katrina=Bad  Emergency  Response,  Iraq=Warmongering;  Guantanamo  Bay=Government  doesn't  torture  unless  given  authority,  The  2007  Financial  Crisis=Actually  2008,  Bad  Housing  Policy  and  Monetary  Policy,  Patriot  Act=Big  Brother  doing  its  thing.      Not  all  of  these  were  related  to  Bush  however.      Hardly!!        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul/  Newsletters_sandbox#Ron_Paul_newsletter_                                                                                controversy        How  about  some  new  blood  that  understands  the  issues  of  today?  We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.[SEP]We  just  entered  and  exited  a  great  worldwide  recession  over  a  period  of  three  years,  in  which  Obama  spent  almost  a  trillion  in  economic  stimulus.      Which  hasn't  done  anything  except  waste  1  trillion  dollars  on  borrowed  money.    Proof:  9.7%  unemployment  in  America.      Plus,  we  were  in  war,  which  is  always  expensive.      Which  is  a  waste.  Money  wasted  due  to  two  warmongers,  Bush  and  Obama.      One  other  thing,  prove  for  me  that  governments  cannot  create  wealth.      Creating  jobs  and  wealth  is  interchangeably  linked  because  if  jobs  are  created  by  producing  an  new  good  or  service,  then  wealth  is  created,  so  in  a  capitalist  economy,  government  has  no  assets  to  produce  anything  without  taxation  that  is  taken  out  of  the  private  sector,  government  doesn't  create  jobs  and  wealth,  it  merely  transfers  jobs  and  wealth  from  private  to  public.      Government  spending  has  three  sources  of  misrepresented  stimulus.    1.  Taxation  doesn't  create  new  jobs  or  wealth  because  it  only  transfers  wealth  from  one  who  creates  new  wealth.  Sure,  government  employees  received  incomes,  but  it  is  at  the  expense  of  those  who  produce.  Government  employees  don't  produce  anything  new,  they  only  take  from  the  general  public.    2.  Government  borrowing  is  just  as  inadequate  as  taxation,  yet  at  least  in  taxation,  it  is  paid.  It  reduces  investment  in  capital,  labor  and  land.  Consequently,  this  translates  into  fewer  new  factories,  machines,  and  homes  being  built.  Not  only  does  this  decrease  in  private  investment  slow  economic  growth,  it  results  in  additional  unemployment  in  these  industries.  Government  borrowing  has  the  illusion  of  wealth.    3.  The  worst  source  of  additional  government  spending  is  creating  new  money  either  by  simply  printing  more  money  or  lower  interest  rates.  Thus,  this  monetary  event  always  results  in  inflation  by  eroding  the  value  of  the  currency,  and  consequently,  it  started  the  Great  Depression.    In  addition,    "But  though  government  can  consume  wealth  and  redistribute  wealth,  it  can't  create  wealth.  And  unless  wealth  is  created,  there  is  nothing  to  consume  or  redistribute.  That's  why  --  even  when  government  is  doing  something  we  all  agree  must  be  done  or  most  of  us  want  to  have  it  do  --  government  is  a  parasite.  All  it  has  is  what  it  takes  from  the  producers  of  wealth...  For  the  economy  to  grow,  government  must  shrink."    Wealth  1      "In  a  capitalistic  economy,  labor  and  capital  freely  flows  to  the  most  productive  enterprises  precisely  because  theyâre  the  most  profitable.  All  government  can  do  is  inefficiently  redistribute  wealth  that  the  private  sector  creates."  Wealth  2      "But  it  is  a  fallacy  of  the  Keynesian  legacy  that  government  can  reduce  unemployment  by  priming  the  pump  with  spending  programs.  Government  needs  to  reduce  spending  and  taxes  in  order  to  leave  income  in  the  hands  of  individuals  who  earned  it  and  who  can  spend  it  much  more  efficiently  than  the  government  can."    Jobs  1      "Governments  have  only  three  ways  of  paying  employees  â  taxes,  borrowing  and  printing  money.  Each  of  those  reduces  income  and  wealth  among  those  paying  taxes,  servicing  debts  or  stuck  with  shrinking  greenbacks.  In  short,  governments  can't  "create  jobs."  Adding  government  jobs  is  never  a  net  addition  to  employment  opportunities,  because  it  means  a  heavier  burden  on  private  employers  and  employees.  "    Jobs  2      "It  overlooks  the  fact  that,  in  the  real  world,  government  canât  inject  money  into  the  economy  without  first  taking  money  out  of  the  economy.  More  specifically,  the  theory  only  looks  at  one-half  of  the  equation  â  the  part  where  government  puts  money  in  the  economyâs  right  pocket.  But  where  does  the  government  get  that  money?  It  borrows  it,  which  means  it  comes  out  of  the  economyâs  left  pocket.  There  is  no  increase  in  what  Keynesians  refer  to  as  aggregate  demand.  Keynesianism  doesnât  boost  national  income,  it  merely  redistributes  it."    Jobs  3      "When  the  government  attempts  to  create  a  job,  all  of  these  natural  forces  are  removed.  The  market  has  produced  no  demand  for  the  government-created  job.  In  other  words,  no  buyer  has  voluntarily  agreed  to  purchase  those  services,  because  to  do  so  under  current  market  conditions  would  be  unprofitable.  Were  it  profitable  to  hire  someone  to  do  the  government-created  job,  an  employer  would  have  done  so  voluntarily.  So,  the  government  steps  in  and  forces  the  taxpayer  to  purchase  those  services  against  his  will.  In  additional  to  violating  the  taxpayerâs  rights,  the  entire  coordination  that  existed  between  employer,  employee,  and  consumer  is  disrupted.  "    Jobs  4      To  illustrate  further,  this  is  what  government  does  to  destroy  wealth  or  job  creation  because  it  thinks  it  can  create  jobs  and  wealth.    WATCH  VIDEO        I  agree  (more  or  less)  with  the  healthcare  reforms,  his  overturning  of  policies  involving  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  the  "Matthew  Shepard  and  James  Byrd,  Jr.  Hate  Crimes  Prevention  Act",  "Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal  Act  of  2010"  and  his  ending  of  the  War  in  Iraq.      More  insurance  isn't  going  to  contain  costs  in  premiums  and  deductibles.  It  is  only  going  be  more  expensive.  When  you  buy  a  car,  you  pay  for  what  you  get.  If  you  want  a  Mercedes  E-Class,  you  have  to  pay  for  it  compared  to  a  Ford  Fiesta.  More  coverage  =  more  money.  This  is  what  the  bill  does,  just  more  insurance.    As  for  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  it  should  be  left  to  private  research.  Polo's  cure  was  invented  by  a  private  scientist,  not  government,  where  in  the  goodness  of  his  heart,  he  donated  it  without  patents  for  profit.    As  for  Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal,  we  will  see  how  effective  it  is  in  the  years  to  come.  One  way  or  another,  I  don't  care.  Military  recruitment  should  be  non  compulsive  and  open  to  anyone  regardless.  Why  does  the  government  need  to  even  know  your  sexual  orientation?  WHY  RED  TAPE!!  That  is  irrelevant  to  a  solider.      because  only  Libertarians  support  doing  nothing  as  massive  businesses  go  bankrupt  and  take  their  employees  and  investors  with  them.      Again,  you  are  an  odd  creature,  you  absolutely  chastise  business  because  it  is  inherently  corrupt  and  greedy,  but  get  all  sympathetic  for  big  business  when  they  go  bankrupt  because  of  bad  management.  Where  is  your  sympathy  for  when  small  bushiness  goes  out  of  business?  There  is  none  because  that  is  business.  Bad  management  equals  failure,  and  you  support  it.  No  wonder  you  like  government.  You  enjoy  bad  management.      Not  all  of  these  were  related  to  Bush  however.      Doesn't  matter.  It  was  still  failure  of  government.  It  is  central  planning  at  its  finest.  A  series  of  failures,  but  no  sees  that.  It  is  government  attempting  to  control  to  many  things,  and  it  fails.      How  about  some  new  blood  that  understands  the  issues  of  today?  We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.      Looks  like  someone  has  a  conspiracy,  someone  who  doesn't  engage  in  conspiracies.    That  controversy  is  as  accurate  as  the  Obama  not  born  in  America.[SEP]I  think  you  contradicted  yourself.      I'm  sure  you  think  that,  but  your  still  wrong.      If  the  creation  of  jobs  is  interchangeable  with  the  creation  of  wealth,  then  it  must  follow  that  the  government  creates  jobs  (and  wealth)  whenever  it  creates  new  organisations      Answer  these  questions.    How  is  government  funded?  Does  government  possess  any  assets  without  taxation?  Does  government  have  any  financial  spending  power  without  taxation?    Government  is  funded  by  private  citizens  in  an  capitalist  economy.  Government  has  no  assets  so  none  of  the  taxation  is  generated  by  its  own  means.      Those  are  not  transferred  jobs  because  there  was  never  a  private  sector  equivalent.      There  is  no  transfer  because  government  prohibits  these  types  of  jobs  to  the  provided  by  private  sector  through  law.      They  produce  technologies  and  monuments  which  are  too  expensive  for  corporations  to  create      Again,  you  only  presume  government  is  the  only  entity  that  can  provide  certain  services.  The  private  sector  may  be  unable  to  provide  a  service  because  of  the  laws  prohibiting  competition  such  as  NASA  or  USPS.    All  of  the  employees  who  work  at  NASA  or  Defense,  whose  money  is  it  that  they  are  using?  Are  these  organizations  self  funded  through  their  own  personal  money?,  No  because  the  employees  whom  work  at  these  places  are  funded  by  taxation,  who  is  paid  by  private  citizens.  Government  employees  taxes  are  just  recycled  into  the  system  because  their  source  of  money  came  from  the  private  sector.  It  is  government  taking  from  private  citizens.      Taxation  takes  surplus  wealth  from  producers  and  uses  it  to  fund  the  creation  of  these  things.      There  is  no  such  as  as  surplus  wealth.  If  government  accounts  for  40%  of  the  100%  of  the  economy,  that  means  that  60%  of  the  economy  must  provide  for  100%  of  the  people  because  40%  is  being  transferred  from  private  to  public.    For  instance,  lets  say  I  am  a  private  citizen  and  you  are  government.  I  produce  100  dollars  of  the  entire  economy  in  our  world  for  100%  of  the  population,  so  you  impose  a  tax  of  5%,  so  now  I  only  have  95  dollars.  Next,  you  say  that  you  will  create  more  jobs.  Where  are  you  going  to  get  it?  Well,  me  because  you  don't  possess  any  assets.  So,  you  impose  a  tax  of  10%,  now,  I  only  have  90  dollars.  Now,  you  want  more  government  jobs,  impose  25%,  now,  I  only  have  75  dollars.  Now,  I  have  to  support  our  economy  on  only  75  dollars  where  it  was  100  because  25  are  being  diverted  to  the  public  sector.      The  great  depression  was  caused  by  insider  trading  and  corruption  of  the  stock  market.      No,  The  Great  Depression  was  caused  by  failure  in  central  bankers.        Milton        Milton        If  the  market  works  like  Natural  Selection,  and  businesses  behave  like  animals,  then  Keynesian  policy  would  merely  be  that  which  applies  artificial  pressure  to  the  evolution  of  business.  If  this  is  true,  then  it  follows  that  the  market's  behaviours  can  be  changed  to  correct  social  problems  like  unemployment.    This  only  shows  your  lack  of  knowledge  of  Keynesian  economics.  It  is  not  about  fixing  social  problems.      If  this  is  true,  then  private  businesses  may  never  create  a  net  addition  to  employment  opportunities  because  they  produce  a  heavier  burden  on  other  private  businesses  and  employees,  because  a  private  business  "charges  money  for  a  service  (same  as  tax),  borrows  money  (loans),  and  prints  coupons  (similar  to  printing  money  practically)."      OH  MY  GOD.  Anyway.  What  Next?      What  I  would  be  interested  in  hearing  is  how  a  tax  is  different  from  a  sale,  practically  speaking.  I'm  not  interested  in  how  you're  compelled  to  pay  tax,  because  force  is  irrelevant  to  the  immediate  equation,  which  is  the  creation  of  jobs  (and  wealth)  through  the  trading  of  money.      Because  private  entrepreneurs  use  their  own  money  by  saving  and  invest  or  if  they  borrow  money,  then  they  pay  it  back,  government  doesn't  use  its  own  money  because  it  doesn't  have  any  of  its  own,  so  any  money  it  borrows,  neither  are  they  paying  it  back  with  your  own  money,  that  burden  is  put  onto  the  shoulders  of  taxpayers.    For  instance,  if  a  man  wants  to  sell  lemonade,  he  will  get  a  loan  from  somewhere  of  5  dollars.  So,  over  the  course  of  the  summer,  the  man  makes  15  dollars  in  revenue,  but  he  must  pay  back  the  5  dollars  in  loan,  and  now  he  has  a  profit  of  10  dollars  where  he  created  new  wealth  and  a  job.    However,  if  government  wants  to  sell  lemonade,  it  must  tax  the  man  5  dollars  because  it  can't  invest  in  anyone  that  of  which  it  does  not  own  because  that  is  what  it  cost  him  to  produce,  so  now,  the  child  only  only  has  a  profit  of  5  dollars,  so  the  output  is  still  15  dollars,  but  it  was  transferred  from  private  to  public  sector.  Then,  the  5  dollars  that  the  government  took,  he  could  have  reinvested  and  hired  a  partner  to  grow.      In  the  discussion  about  economics,  what  matters  is  that  money  changes  hands.      And  that  money  is  who  does  the  money  belong  to.      Those  state  sales  permits  and  laws  which  prohibit  business  startup  are  usually  motivated  by  business  interests  who  wish  to  stifle  competitors.      This  is  what  I  have  been  saying  time  and  time  again.      It's  how  capitalism  works  in  democracy.      It's  how  corporatism  works  in  democracy.      Right.  We  also  needed  it,  since  our  healthcare  coverage  is  so  poor  in  this  country.      Healthcare  coverage  is  so  poor  because  it  is  rationed  care  not  driven  by  market  forces,  but  you  want  government  run  health  care  where  even  more  ration  care  will  emerge.    If  you  wanted  more  expensive  coverage,  that  is  what  you  got.  Congrats.      Government-funded  research  exists  because  most  research  is  costly  and  unprofitable  to  the  private  market.      Never  said  that  it  is  for  only  profit  market.  Research  should  be  non  profit.    Mayo  Clinic  is  one  of  the  most  respected  nonprofit  medical  research  organizations  in  the  world.      Polio's  researchers  and  early  efforts  to  make  a  vaccine  used  a  similar  lack  of  ethics:  3000  children  were  injected  with  an  unsuccessful  mixture  which  caused  allergic  reactions  in  some  of  them.        Well,  they  cured  Polio.  BUT    Your  going  to  cry  over  the  few  for  the  many.    REMEMBER  YOU  ARE  A  BIG  ADVOCATE  FOR  GREATER  GOOD.      Polio  was  a  life  threatening  disease,  and  it  is  gone.      government  takes  over  where  private  industry  would  fail  or  be  less  successful.      There  is  nowhere  where  government  has  done  better  than  private  industry  if  so,  because  government  has  no  competition,  NASA,  USPS  (First  class  mail),  and  Education      As  to  the  stem  cells:  you  can  thank  Bush  for  regulating  stem  cells  in  the  first  place.  Obama  rescinded  his  laws.      Why  do  you  keep  assuming  I  applaud  Bush?  Those  laws  hurt  non  profit  search  as  well  as  your  government  research.      It  didn't,  and  wouldn't  ask,  as  long  as  you  didn't  provide  it.  However  what  happened  was  that  many  officers  and  recruits  were  discharged  annually  because  they  were  spotted  in  gay  clubs  on  shoreleave,  or  "outed"  by  malicious  coworkers.      Again,  this  resorts  to  bad  government  military  policy  because  before,  you  could  get  dishonorable  discharge  for  being  gay.  This  type  of  policy  is  stupid.        I'm  not  sympathetic  for  big  business.      Despite  your  sentiments  for  the  little  guy,  you  are  because  no  matter  how  much  of  a  complete  failure  management  was,  you  think  that  they  should  be  bailed  out.  Those  workers  would  just  find  different  jobs.      I  think  it  does  an  admirable  job  handling  the  roads,  sewers,  water,  schools,  medical  research,  space  programs,  and  research.      Well,  Great!  I  am  so  glad  that  you  feel  proud  of  the  progress  that  you  support.        I  certainly  know  that  only  a  state  could  afford  a  project  as  big  as  the  Large  Hadron  Collider.      I  am  certain  that  one  man,  Branson,  will  be  able  to  provide  space  travel  for  any  paying  customer  instead  of  the  select  few  the  government  picks.  Maybe,  space  travel  may  become  as  inexpensive  that  anyone  will  be  able  to  fly  and  experience  it.    By  the  way,  you  gave  me  a  headache.	1
We  should  give  him  another  opportunity.  I  saw  that  he  tried  to  work  his  best.  No  reason  we  don't  give  him  another  opportunity  ...  I  think  that.[SEP]So  taking  his  time  filling  out  NCAA  brackets  is  trying  his  hardest?	1
Absolutely  not!  He  has  tried  to  do  what  he  said,  but  if  you  rate  him  based  on  a  scorecard  of  how  well  he  is  implementing  change,  I  would  say  he  is  failing.[SEP]Would  you  not  give  him  any  credit  for  anything  he  has  done  so  far?  Or  are  you  against  him  100%?    Do  you  feel  like  his  health  care  bill  was  a  mistake?    Would  you  not  also  say  that  he  entered  the  presidency  in  an  extremely  rough  time?    In  my  opinion  I  say  we  give  him  the  next  four,  he  is  not  nearly  as  bad  as  the  eight  years  that  preceded  him.  I  feel  like  he  is  trying  to  implement  change,  and  do  what  he  set  out  to  do  in  the  beginning  of  his  campaign.    I  really  see  no  president  that  is  going  to  do  a  better  job  (  at  least  that  has  a  chance  of  getting  elected  )  than  Obama,  unless  you  had  someone  in  mind  that  had  a  hope  of  winning?[SEP]Would  you  not  give  him  any  credit  for  anything  he  has  done  so  far?      Sure,  he  should  be  granted  credit  for  instituting  progress  towards  socialism.      Or  are  you  against  him  100%?      Correct.      Would  you  not  also  say  that  he  entered  the  presidency  in  an  extremely  rough  time?      Sure,  to  a  certain  degree.  Only  because  of  bad  government  policy.      he  is  not  nearly  as  bad  as  the  eight  years  that  preceded  him.      What  was  so  bad  about  the  last  eight  years  besides  the  war?      I  feel  like  he  is  trying  to  implement  change,  and  do  what  he  set  out  to  do  in  the  beginning  of  his  campaign.      Doesn't  mean  that  it  is  change  for  GOOD.  He  never  said  Change  was  going  to  be  for  the  better.      I  really  see  no  president  that  is  going  to  do  a  better  job  (  at  least  that  has  a  chance  of  getting  elected  )  than  Obama,  unless  you  had  someone  in  mind  that  had  a  hope  of  winning?      Ron  Paul[SEP]Sure,  he  should  be  granted  credit  for  instituting  progress  towards  socialism.      Such  as?  If  you  say  "healthcare"  you  fail.      Correct.      Black  and  white  thinking.      Sure,  to  a  certain  degree.  Only  because  of  bad  government  policy.      And  Dubya.      What  was  so  bad  about  the  last  eight  years  besides  the  war?      Well,  let's  see...  the  whole  9/11  debacle,  Katrina,  the  choice  to  invade  Iraq  instead  of  Saudi  Arabia,  The  2007  Financial  Crisis,  Guantanamo  Bay  and  the  black  site  operations,  The  Patriot  Act,  etc.    Not  all  of  these  are  related  to  Bush,  but  you  asked.      Doesn't  mean  that  it  is  change  for  GOOD.  He  never  said  Change  was  going  to  be  for  the  better.      If  you  don't  like  it,  he  must  be  doing  SOMETHING  right.      Ron  Paul      That  bigoted  fossil?  You're  crazy.[SEP]Such  as?  If  you  say  "healthcare"  you  fail.      Have  you  seen  government  spending  lately?  President  Obama's  2010  Budget  Deficit  was  $1.3  trillion.    For  every  dollar  the  government  spends,  that  is  one  less  dollar  in  the  private  economy,  which  the  economy  shrinks,  which  means  less  wealth  is  created.    Here  is  a  predicted  graph  of  government  spending,  and  this  is  only  FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT.    Graph    So,  sometime  between  2030  to  2040,  entitlements  will  alone  consume  the  entire  budget  unless  more  taxes  or  less  spending.      Black  and  white  thinking.      If  you  are  not  an  liberal  and  vehemently  support  Obama,  why  are  you  seeking  an  dispute  of  my  response?    If  so,  then  what  percentage  roughly  do  you  agree  with  ?him      And  Dubya.      No,  doubt  he  was  a  failure.      Well,  let's  see...  the  whole  9/11  debacle,  Katrina,  the  choice  to  invade  Iraq  instead  of  Saudi  Arabia,  The  2007  Financial  Crisis,  Guantanamo  Bay  and  the  black  site  operations,  The  Patriot  Act,  etc.      What  you  pointed  out  are  failures  of  government  policy.  9/11=Bad  Intelligence,  Katrina=Bad  Emergency  Response,  Iraq=Warmongering;  Guantanamo  Bay=Government  doesn't  torture  unless  given  authority,  The  2007  Financial  Crisis=Actually  2008,  Bad  Housing  Policy  and  Monetary  Policy,  Patriot  Act=Big  Brother  doing  its  thing.      That  bigoted  fossil?  You're  crazy.      Hardly!![SEP]Have  you  seen  government  spending  lately?  President  Obama's  2010  Budget  Deficit  was  $1.3  trillion.    For  every  dollar  the  government  spends,  that  is  one  less  dollar  in  the  private  economy,  which  the  economy  shrinks,  which  means  less  wealth  is  created.      We  just  entered  and  exited  a  great  worldwide  recession  over  a  period  of  three  years,  in  which  Obama  spent  almost  a  trillion  in  economic  stimulus.    Plus,  we  were  in  war,  which  is  always  expensive.    One  other  thing,  prove  for  me  that  governments  cannot  create  wealth.      If  you  are  not  an  liberal  and  vehemently  support  Obama,  why  are  you  seeking  an  dispute  of  my  response?    If  so,  then  what  percentage  roughly  do  you  agree  with  ?him      I  agree  (more  or  less)  with  the  healthcare  reforms,  his  overturning  of  policies  involving  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  the  "Matthew  Shepard  and  James  Byrd,  Jr.  Hate  Crimes  Prevention  Act",  "Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal  Act  of  2010"  and  his  ending  of  the  War  in  Iraq.  I  am  ambivalent  about  his  economic  policies  but  I  do  not  believe  a  Republican  President  would  have  done  much  different,  because  only  Libertarians  support  doing  nothing  as  massive  businesses  go  bankrupt  and  take  their  employees  and  investors  with  them.    His  diplomacy  might  be  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  I  do  not  know  however.  It  seems  to  me  that  a  majority  of  these  Islamic  States  would  want  to  work  with  us  in  eliminating  terrorism  since  they  are  have  their  own  share  of  sectarian  bombings,  but  the  religious  mindset  is  an  odd  one.      What  you  pointed  out  are  failures  of  government  policy.  9/11=Bad  Intelligence,  Katrina=Bad  Emergency  Response,  Iraq=Warmongering;  Guantanamo  Bay=Government  doesn't  torture  unless  given  authority,  The  2007  Financial  Crisis=Actually  2008,  Bad  Housing  Policy  and  Monetary  Policy,  Patriot  Act=Big  Brother  doing  its  thing.      Not  all  of  these  were  related  to  Bush  however.      Hardly!!        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul/  Newsletters_sandbox#Ron_Paul_newsletter_                                                                                controversy        How  about  some  new  blood  that  understands  the  issues  of  today?  We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.[SEP]We  just  entered  and  exited  a  great  worldwide  recession  over  a  period  of  three  years,  in  which  Obama  spent  almost  a  trillion  in  economic  stimulus.      Which  hasn't  done  anything  except  waste  1  trillion  dollars  on  borrowed  money.    Proof:  9.7%  unemployment  in  America.      Plus,  we  were  in  war,  which  is  always  expensive.      Which  is  a  waste.  Money  wasted  due  to  two  warmongers,  Bush  and  Obama.      One  other  thing,  prove  for  me  that  governments  cannot  create  wealth.      Creating  jobs  and  wealth  is  interchangeably  linked  because  if  jobs  are  created  by  producing  an  new  good  or  service,  then  wealth  is  created,  so  in  a  capitalist  economy,  government  has  no  assets  to  produce  anything  without  taxation  that  is  taken  out  of  the  private  sector,  government  doesn't  create  jobs  and  wealth,  it  merely  transfers  jobs  and  wealth  from  private  to  public.      Government  spending  has  three  sources  of  misrepresented  stimulus.    1.  Taxation  doesn't  create  new  jobs  or  wealth  because  it  only  transfers  wealth  from  one  who  creates  new  wealth.  Sure,  government  employees  received  incomes,  but  it  is  at  the  expense  of  those  who  produce.  Government  employees  don't  produce  anything  new,  they  only  take  from  the  general  public.    2.  Government  borrowing  is  just  as  inadequate  as  taxation,  yet  at  least  in  taxation,  it  is  paid.  It  reduces  investment  in  capital,  labor  and  land.  Consequently,  this  translates  into  fewer  new  factories,  machines,  and  homes  being  built.  Not  only  does  this  decrease  in  private  investment  slow  economic  growth,  it  results  in  additional  unemployment  in  these  industries.  Government  borrowing  has  the  illusion  of  wealth.    3.  The  worst  source  of  additional  government  spending  is  creating  new  money  either  by  simply  printing  more  money  or  lower  interest  rates.  Thus,  this  monetary  event  always  results  in  inflation  by  eroding  the  value  of  the  currency,  and  consequently,  it  started  the  Great  Depression.    In  addition,    "But  though  government  can  consume  wealth  and  redistribute  wealth,  it  can't  create  wealth.  And  unless  wealth  is  created,  there  is  nothing  to  consume  or  redistribute.  That's  why  --  even  when  government  is  doing  something  we  all  agree  must  be  done  or  most  of  us  want  to  have  it  do  --  government  is  a  parasite.  All  it  has  is  what  it  takes  from  the  producers  of  wealth...  For  the  economy  to  grow,  government  must  shrink."    Wealth  1      "In  a  capitalistic  economy,  labor  and  capital  freely  flows  to  the  most  productive  enterprises  precisely  because  theyâre  the  most  profitable.  All  government  can  do  is  inefficiently  redistribute  wealth  that  the  private  sector  creates."  Wealth  2      "But  it  is  a  fallacy  of  the  Keynesian  legacy  that  government  can  reduce  unemployment  by  priming  the  pump  with  spending  programs.  Government  needs  to  reduce  spending  and  taxes  in  order  to  leave  income  in  the  hands  of  individuals  who  earned  it  and  who  can  spend  it  much  more  efficiently  than  the  government  can."    Jobs  1      "Governments  have  only  three  ways  of  paying  employees  â  taxes,  borrowing  and  printing  money.  Each  of  those  reduces  income  and  wealth  among  those  paying  taxes,  servicing  debts  or  stuck  with  shrinking  greenbacks.  In  short,  governments  can't  "create  jobs."  Adding  government  jobs  is  never  a  net  addition  to  employment  opportunities,  because  it  means  a  heavier  burden  on  private  employers  and  employees.  "    Jobs  2      "It  overlooks  the  fact  that,  in  the  real  world,  government  canât  inject  money  into  the  economy  without  first  taking  money  out  of  the  economy.  More  specifically,  the  theory  only  looks  at  one-half  of  the  equation  â  the  part  where  government  puts  money  in  the  economyâs  right  pocket.  But  where  does  the  government  get  that  money?  It  borrows  it,  which  means  it  comes  out  of  the  economyâs  left  pocket.  There  is  no  increase  in  what  Keynesians  refer  to  as  aggregate  demand.  Keynesianism  doesnât  boost  national  income,  it  merely  redistributes  it."    Jobs  3      "When  the  government  attempts  to  create  a  job,  all  of  these  natural  forces  are  removed.  The  market  has  produced  no  demand  for  the  government-created  job.  In  other  words,  no  buyer  has  voluntarily  agreed  to  purchase  those  services,  because  to  do  so  under  current  market  conditions  would  be  unprofitable.  Were  it  profitable  to  hire  someone  to  do  the  government-created  job,  an  employer  would  have  done  so  voluntarily.  So,  the  government  steps  in  and  forces  the  taxpayer  to  purchase  those  services  against  his  will.  In  additional  to  violating  the  taxpayerâs  rights,  the  entire  coordination  that  existed  between  employer,  employee,  and  consumer  is  disrupted.  "    Jobs  4      To  illustrate  further,  this  is  what  government  does  to  destroy  wealth  or  job  creation  because  it  thinks  it  can  create  jobs  and  wealth.    WATCH  VIDEO        I  agree  (more  or  less)  with  the  healthcare  reforms,  his  overturning  of  policies  involving  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  the  "Matthew  Shepard  and  James  Byrd,  Jr.  Hate  Crimes  Prevention  Act",  "Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal  Act  of  2010"  and  his  ending  of  the  War  in  Iraq.      More  insurance  isn't  going  to  contain  costs  in  premiums  and  deductibles.  It  is  only  going  be  more  expensive.  When  you  buy  a  car,  you  pay  for  what  you  get.  If  you  want  a  Mercedes  E-Class,  you  have  to  pay  for  it  compared  to  a  Ford  Fiesta.  More  coverage  =  more  money.  This  is  what  the  bill  does,  just  more  insurance.    As  for  Embryonic  Stem  Cells,  it  should  be  left  to  private  research.  Polo's  cure  was  invented  by  a  private  scientist,  not  government,  where  in  the  goodness  of  his  heart,  he  donated  it  without  patents  for  profit.    As  for  Don't  Ask,  Don't  Tell  Repeal,  we  will  see  how  effective  it  is  in  the  years  to  come.  One  way  or  another,  I  don't  care.  Military  recruitment  should  be  non  compulsive  and  open  to  anyone  regardless.  Why  does  the  government  need  to  even  know  your  sexual  orientation?  WHY  RED  TAPE!!  That  is  irrelevant  to  a  solider.      because  only  Libertarians  support  doing  nothing  as  massive  businesses  go  bankrupt  and  take  their  employees  and  investors  with  them.      Again,  you  are  an  odd  creature,  you  absolutely  chastise  business  because  it  is  inherently  corrupt  and  greedy,  but  get  all  sympathetic  for  big  business  when  they  go  bankrupt  because  of  bad  management.  Where  is  your  sympathy  for  when  small  bushiness  goes  out  of  business?  There  is  none  because  that  is  business.  Bad  management  equals  failure,  and  you  support  it.  No  wonder  you  like  government.  You  enjoy  bad  management.      Not  all  of  these  were  related  to  Bush  however.      Doesn't  matter.  It  was  still  failure  of  government.  It  is  central  planning  at  its  finest.  A  series  of  failures,  but  no  sees  that.  It  is  government  attempting  to  control  to  many  things,  and  it  fails.      How  about  some  new  blood  that  understands  the  issues  of  today?  We  don't  need  fossils  screwing  up  progress  due  to  their  old  prejudices.      Looks  like  someone  has  a  conspiracy,  someone  who  doesn't  engage  in  conspiracies.    That  controversy  is  as  accurate  as  the  Obama  not  born  in  America.[SEP]Answer  these  questions.    How  is  government  funded?  Does  government  possess  any  assets  without  taxation?  Does  government  have  any  financial  authority  without  taxation?      Technically  speaking  our  government  owns  nothing  because  it  is  public,  however  practically  speaking  it  owns  its  institutions  and  their  collective  works.    Does  a  business  have  any  financial  authority  without  charging  a  bill?  In  other  words,  speaking  in  the  context  of  our  discussion,  taxation  and  a  private  bill  are  practically  the  same.      Government  is  funded  by  private  citizens  in  an  capitalist  economy.  Government  has  no  assets  so  none  of  the  taxation  is  generated  by  its  own  means.      It  doesn't  matter  if  a  business  generates  income  by  itself,  it  matters  if  it  generates  it  by  exchange  with  others.      There  is  no  transfer  because  government  prohibits  these  types  of  jobs  to  the  private  sector  by  law.      Does  not  change  the  fact  that  they  are  not  transferred  jobs,  but  created  ones.      Again,  you  only  presume  government  is  the  only  entity  that  can  provide  certain  services.  The  private  sector  is  may  be  unable  to  provide  a  service  because  of  the  laws  prohibiting  competition  such  as  NASA  or  USPS.      Only  the  wealthiest  oil  corporations  could  hope  to  touch  our  military  budget,  and  yet  they  fall  short  by  about  half.  That  is  to  say  nothing  of  medical  research,  aerospace  research  and  engineering,  and  physics  research  like  the  LHC  which  are  all  in  addition  to  the  military  budget.      All  of  the  employees  who  work  at  NASA  or  Defense,  whose  money  is  it  that  they  are  using.  Are  these  organizations  self  funded  through  their  own  personal  money?,  No  because  the  employees  whom  work  at  these  places  are  funded  by  taxation,  who  is  paid  by  private  citizens.  Government  employees  taxes  are  just  recycled  into  the  system  because  their  source  of  money  can  from  the  private  sector.  It  is  government  taking  from  private  citizens.      They  use  their  own  money,  which  comes  from  providing  a  service  to  the  public  (taxes),  through  trade  of  goods  (technology  to  the  private  sector  and  other  governments).      There  is  no  such  as  as  surplus  wealth.  If  government  accounts  for  40%  of  the  100%  of  the  economy,  that  means  that  60%  of  the  economy  must  provide  for  100%  of  the  people  because  40%  is  being  transferred  from  private  to  public.      It  really  isn't  that  simple,  because  a  portion  of  that  40%  is  often  made  accessible  to  the  people  in  the  form  of  student  aid,  welfare,  unemployment,  social  security,  schools,  medicine,  etc.  The  other  60%  as  utilised  by  the  private  sector  is  never  distributed  in  a  manner  approaching  equality  and  that  is  why  you  have  one  percent  of  the  people  holding  fourty  percent  of  it  (which  would  mean  as  per  your  numbers  that  1%  of  the  people  hold  16%  of  the  nation's  economy  in  their  hands).    To  answer  your  actual  question  however,  what  I  mean  by  surplus  wealth  is  that  wealth  which  is  beyond  the  living  means  of  the  owner.      For  instance,  lets  say  I  am  a  private  citizen  and  you  are  government.  I  produce  100  dollars  of  the  entire  economy  in  our  world  for  100%  of  the  population,  so  you  impose  a  tax  of  5%,  so  now  I  only  have  95  dollars.  Next,  you  say  that  you  will  create  more  jobs.  Where  are  you  going  to  get  it?  Well,  me  because  you  don't  possess  any  assets.  So,  you  impose  a  tax  of  10%,  now,  I  only  have  90  dollars.  Now,  you  want  more  government  jobs,  impose  25%,  now,  I  only  have  75  dollars.  So,  now,  I  have  to  support  our  economy  on  only  75  dollars  where  it  was  100  because  25  are  being  diverted  to  the  public  sector.      It's  the  same  exact  issue  with  private  companies.  If  you  have  100  dollars,  and  this  is  the  total  GDP,  and  a  business  charges  you  5$  for  medicine,  you  now  have  95$  and  the  business  has  5$.  The  business  did  not  increase  the  GDP  to  105$.  Conservation  of  wealth,  like  conservation  of  energy.      Milton    Milton      I  never  cared  for  Milton  Friedman's  opinion.  He's  a  bit  of  a  nutter.      This  only  shows  your  lack  of  knowledge  of  Keynesian  economics.  It  is  not  about  fixing  social  problems.      Keynesian  economics  is  merely  the  idea  that  government  can  intervene  to  stimulate  the  market  where  it  is  acting  with  reduced  efficiency.      Because  private  entrepreneurs  use  their  own  money  by  saving  and  invest  or  if  they  borrow  money,  then  they  pay  it  back,  government  doesn't  use  its  own  money  because  it  doesn't  have  any  of  its  own,  so  any  money  it  borrows,  neither  are  they  paying  it  back  with  your  own  money,  that  burden  is  put  onto  the  shoulders  of  taxpayers.      You  just  explained  how  a  government  uses  tax,  and  the  behaviours  surrounding  government  borrowing.  What  I'm  interested  in  is  the  fundamental  changing  of  hands  which  both  sales  and  taxes  employ.      And  that  money  is  who  money  does  it  belong  to.      It  would  be  the  government's  money,  since  they  provided  a  service  and  you  are  paying  for  it.      It's  how  corporatism  works  in  democracy.      Same  thing.      Healthcare  coverage  is  so  poor  because  it  is  rationed  care  not  driven  by  market  forces,  but  you  want  government  run  health  care  where  even  more  ration  care  will  emerge.      The  healthcare  act  is  not  socialised  medicine.  It  is  private  medicine,  which  means  that  the  "rationed  care"  you  speak  of  is  a  capitalist  phenomenon.      Well,  they  cured  Polio.  BUT    Your  going  to  cry  over  the  few  for  the  many.  REMEMBER  YOU  ARE  A  BIG  ADVOCATE  FOR  GREATER  GOOD.    Polio  was  a  life  threatening  disease,  and  it  is  gone.      It  is  a  matter  of  the  "welfare  of  the  few,  for  the  many"  because  right  now  those  bad  ethics  are  wildly  illegal.  If  they  were  not,  it  wouldn't  be  the  few  any  longer  but  a  large  number  of  annual  deaths  and  deformities  caused  by  standard  medical  research  practice.      There  is  nowhere  where  government  has  done  better  than  private  industry  if  so,  because  government  has  no  competition,  NASA,  USPS  (First  class  mail),  and  Education      Most  of  them  you  hardly  notice:  roads,  research,  technological  development,  military,  police,  courts.  Also:  government  put  a  man  on  the  moon  and  a  probe  on  mars.  What  has  big  business  done  for  you?      Why  do  you  keep  assuming  I  applaud  Bush?  Those  laws  hurt  non  profit  search  as  well  as  your  government  research.      I  don't.      Despite  your  sentiments  for  the  little  guy,  you  are  because  no  matter  how  much  of  a  complete  failure  management  was,  you  think  that  they  should  be  bailed  out.  Those  workers  would  just  find  different  jobs.      Just  wait  until  you  get  fired  or  laid  off  from  your  career  at  age  fifty,  and  are  desperate  to  find  work  for  almost  a  year  but  no  one  hires  you  because  you're  old  and  they  want  new,  young  professionals.  You  really  have  no  empathy  for  these  people  because  you're  too  self-absorbed.    One  other  detail:  since  many  thousands  of  them  would  be  laid  off,  this  means  that  the  market  would  be  suddenly  flooded  with  people  who  have  the  same  credentials,  which  means  they  would  probably  receive  lower  salaries  on  top  of  losing  their  retirement.      I  am  certain  that  one  man,  Branson,  will  be  able  to  provide  space  travel  for  any  paying  customer  instead  of  the  select  few  the  government  picks.  Maybe,  space  travel  may  become  as  inexpensive  that  anyone  will  be  able  to  fly  and  experience  it.      I'm  not  as  hopeful,  look  at  airline  security  and  how  often  a  plane  crashes.  I  can  just  imagine  the  skies  being  littered  with  thousands  of  bodies  due  to  cost-cutting  and  terrorists.	0
Absolutely  not!  He  has  tried  to  do  what  he  said,  but  if  you  rate  him  based  on  a  scorecard  of  how  well  he  is  implementing  change,  I  would  say  he  is  failing.[SEP]Would  you  not  give  him  any  credit  for  anything  he  has  done  so  far?  Or  are  you  against  him  100%?    Do  you  feel  like  his  health  care  bill  was  a  mistake?    Would  you  not  also  say  that  he  entered  the  presidency  in  an  extremely  rough  time?    In  my  opinion  I  say  we  give  him  the  next  four,  he  is  not  nearly  as  bad  as  the  eight  years  that  preceded  him.  I  feel  like  he  is  trying  to  implement  change,  and  do  what  he  set  out  to  do  in  the  beginning  of  his  campaign.    I  really  see  no  president  that  is  going  to  do  a  better  job  (  at  least  that  has  a  chance  of  getting  elected  )  than  Obama,  unless  you  had  someone  in  mind  that  had  a  hope  of  winning?[SEP]Would  you  not  give  him  any  credit  for  anything  he  has  done  so  far?      Sure,  he  should  be  granted  credit  for  instituting  progress  towards  socialism.      Or  are  you  against  him  100%?      Correct.      Would  you  not  also  say  that  he  entered  the  presidency  in  an  extremely  rough  time?      Sure,  to  a  certain  degree.  Only  because  of  bad  government  policy.      he  is  not  nearly  as  bad  as  the  eight  years  that  preceded  him.      What  was  so  bad  about  the  last  eight  years  besides  the  war?      I  feel  like  he  is  trying  to  implement  change,  and  do  what  he  set  out  to  do  in  the  beginning  of  his  campaign.      Doesn't  mean  that  it  is  change  for  GOOD.  He  never  said  Change  was  going  to  be  for  the  better.      I  really  see  no  president  that  is  going  to  do  a  better  job  (  at  least  that  has  a  chance  of  getting  elected  )  than  Obama,  unless  you  had  someone  in  mind  that  had  a  hope  of  winning?      Ron  Paul[SEP]Are  you  kidding  me?    He  deserves  credit.  He  saved  the  economy,  is  stopping  wars,  and  is  doing  great  things  for  our  country.      Your  against  him  100%,  but  you  don't  care  anything  about  anything  he  has  done.  You  against  him  and  you  are  against  the  war,  and  you  are  in  a  complete  mindset  not  to  accept  anything  he  does.      And  the  past  8  years?  Well  first  of  all,  you  mention  the  war  as  if  its  a  bad  thing.  Do  you  also  remember;  Economy,  Debt,  foreign  affairs  etc.?  Bush  was  ruining  a  lot  of  things  in  America.  Obama  is  fixing  them,  and  helping  more  better  things  happen.    As  for  Change,  are  aware  of  what  he  has  done?  He  has  changed  our  situations  across  the  world,  has  had  our  number  1  enemy  (Osama)  killed,  helped  keep  the  economy  from  crashing,  and  made  great  leaps  and  bounds  for  peace  across  the  world.  If  you  believe  these  changes  aren't  'good'  then  think  it  over  for  a  bit.      And  finally,  you  believe  there  are  several  other  people  who  would  do  better  as  him,  but  would  they  really?  Do  they  have  enough  experience  expertise,  intelligence,  etc.  to  keep  our  country  alive?      Seriously,  think  about  these  points.    You  have  a  strong  opinion,  but  make  sure  you  aren't  ignoring  fact.	0
Absolutely  not!  He  has  tried  to  do  what  he  said,  but  if  you  rate  him  based  on  a  scorecard  of  how  well  he  is  implementing  change,  I  would  say  he  is  failing.[SEP]Would  you  not  give  him  any  credit  for  anything  he  has  done  so  far?  Or  are  you  against  him  100%?    Do  you  feel  like  his  health  care  bill  was  a  mistake?    Would  you  not  also  say  that  he  entered  the  presidency  in  an  extremely  rough  time?    In  my  opinion  I  say  we  give  him  the  next  four,  he  is  not  nearly  as  bad  as  the  eight  years  that  preceded  him.  I  feel  like  he  is  trying  to  implement  change,  and  do  what  he  set  out  to  do  in  the  beginning  of  his  campaign.    I  really  see  no  president  that  is  going  to  do  a  better  job  (  at  least  that  has  a  chance  of  getting  elected  )  than  Obama,  unless  you  had  someone  in  mind  that  had  a  hope  of  winning?[SEP]Here  Here!  every  president  with  outstanding  performance,  pleasing  personality,  and  with  high-educated  standard  is  qualified  and  deserving  in  its  position  like  Obama.	0

No!  No  more  politics  as  usual!  I  want  someone  in  office  who  will  push  for  less  government,  more  freedom  for  the  people,  less  taxation,  humbly  take  up  the  office  of  President,  someone  who  is  invested  in  this  country  personally  (i.e.  John  Boehner,  he  was  crying  because  of  his  elevation  to  speaker,  he  has  a  heart  for  this  country  and  it  shows).  President  Obama  will  always  hold  my  respect  but  I  do  not  want  him  in  the  white  house  again.	1

being  a  good  speech  maker  and  being  a  good  president  are  two  different  things,  our  'leader'  has  seamed  to  have  jumbled  them  up  a  bit.  I  could  ramble  on  about  wanting  to  change  things  in  our  country  but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  he  has  yet  to  change  anything  except  raising  our  taxes  more.  No,  no,  absolutely  not.	1
I  have  no  trust  for  Obama  anymore!  I  can't  trust  somebody  who  believes  its  okay  to  build  a  mosqe  at  ground  zero  in  New  York!	1
He  should  have  never  been  elected  to  start  with!  He  is  anti-America!	1
Can  Obongo  show  proof  of  his  birth?  What  has  he  accomplished  besides  bringing  Hollywood  into  the  White  House?  Would  you  continue  to  like  the  USA  to  look  weak  and  frail  in  a  world  of  mighty  wolves?  Would  you  like  Mahmoud  Ahmadenijad,  Kim  Jong  II  and  Hugo  Chavez  to  have  more  nuclear  weapons  than  you?  Would  you  like  your  First  Lady  to  come  to  your  home  to  tell  your  children  what  you  can  and  can't  feed  them?  Would  you  like  your  First  Lady  to  have  a  penis?

I  strongly  believe  that  Obama  should  be  given  a  second  term.  Since  Obama  has  been  in  power,  he  has  been  trying  his  best  to  make  certain  achievements.  We  all  know,  that  in  the  state  that  our  ecomony  is,  it  will  not  take  weeks  or  months  but  possibly  years  to  fix  or  embetter  and  for  this  reason,  we  should  give  him  another  chance  since  his  leadership  has  cultivated  many  presidential  achievements.  We  tend  to  blame  him  for  not  trying  his  best  to  embetter  the  economy  but  what  we  are  failing  to  understand  is  the  fact  that  this  is  his  first  term  in  office  and  the  economy  is  not  something  you  can  fix  in  a  second,  it  is  a  critical  aspect  that  requires  careful  thought,  planning,  analysis  and  actions  which  can  take  several  years.  It  is  also  through  President  Obama  and  his  supporters  that  the  health  care  bill,  legislation  to  curb  green  house  gases  and  improve  the  environment  passes,  preventing  a  second  great  depression  by  saving  three  large  car  manufacturers  from  going  out  of  business  and  which  would  have  possibly  leave  hundreds  or  thousands  without  jobs,  and  also  passed  the  largest  economic  stimulus  bill,  bringing  the  war  in  Iraq  to  an  end,  thus  saving  the  economy  a  lot  of  money  and  innocent  lives  from  being  taken,  nuclear  non-proliferation  movement,  repairing  our  image  abroad,  reversed  George  Bush's  ban  on  federal  funding  to  foreign  organizations  that  allows  abortion,  lifted  Bush's  ban  on  embryonic  stem  cell  research,  implementation  of  education  system  reform,  tobacco  regulation,  financial  industry  reformation,  appointing  two  Supreme  Court  Justices.  These  are  the  presidential  accomplishments  achieved  by  Obama  and  these  are  proof  that  the  president  is  determined  to  fullfill  his  promoses  he  had  first  made  to  the  nation.  Now,  it  is  our  turn  to  give  him  the  chance  he  need  to  do  so  and  give  him  some  more  time.	0

I  strongly  believe  that  Obama  should  be  given  a  second  term.  Since  Obama  has  been  in  power,  he  has  been  trying  his  best  to  make  certain  achievements.  We  all  know,  that  in  the  state  that  our  ecomony  is,  it  will  not  take  weeks  or  months  but  possibly  years  to  fix  or  embetter  and  for  this  reason,  we  should  give  him  another  chance  since  his  leadership  has  cultivated  many  presidential  achievements.  We  tend  to  blame  him  for  not  trying  his  best  to  embetter  the  economy  but  what  we  are  failing  to  understand  is  the  fact  that  this  is  his  first  term  in  office  and  the  economy  is  not  something  you  can  fix  in  a  second,  it  is  a  critical  aspect  that  requires  careful  thought,  planning,  analysis  and  actions  which  can  take  several  years.  It  is  also  through  President  Obama  and  his  supporters  that  the  health  care  bill,  legislation  to  curb  green  house  gases  and  improve  the  environment  passes,  preventing  a  second  great  depression  by  saving  three  large  car  manufacturers  from  going  out  of  business  and  which  would  have  possibly  leave  hundreds  or  thousands  without  jobs,  and  also  passed  the  largest  economic  stimulus  bill,  bringing  the  war  in  Iraq  to  an  end,  thus  saving  the  economy  a  lot  of  money  and  innocent  lives  from  being  taken,  nuclear  non-proliferation  movement,  repairing  our  image  abroad,  reversed  George  Bush's  ban  on  federal  funding  to  foreign  organizations  that  allows  abortion,  lifted  Bush's  ban  on  embryonic  stem  cell  research,  implementation  of  education  system  reform,  tobacco  regulation,  financial  industry  reformation,  appointing  two  Supreme  Court  Justices.  These  are  the  presidential  accomplishments  achieved  by  Obama  and  these  are  proof  that  the  president  is  determined  to  fullfill  his  promoses  he  had  first  made  to  the  nation.  Now,  it  is  our  turn  to  give  him  the  chance  he  need  to  do  so  and  give  him  some  more  time.[SEP]I  agree  because  Obama  has  done  a  change  to  the  United  States  of  America  an  he  should  get  his  second  term.  He's  changed  many  thing  and  trying  to  sort  other  promblems  nobody  thinks  about.	0

No  absolutley  no  because  he  is  communist  marxist  who  has  tried  to  destroy  america  from  the  inside  on  seperate  occasions  and  if  re  elected  be  sure  to  live  like  slaves  to  a  communist  goverment	1
I  strongly  believe  that  Obama  should  be  given  a  second  term.  Since  Obama  has  been  in  power,  he  has  been  trying  his  best  to  make  certain  achievements.  We  all  know,  that  in  the  state  that  our  ecomony  is,  it  will  not  take  weeks  or  months  but  possibly  years  to  fix  or  embetter  and  for  this  reason,  we  should  give  him  another  chance  since  his  leadership  has  cultivated  many  presidential  achievements.  We  tend  to  blame  him  for  not  trying  his  best  to  embetter  the  economy  but  what  we  are  failing  to  understand  is  the  fact  that  this  is  his  first  term  in  office  and  the  economy  is  not  something  you  can  fix  in  a  second,  it  is  a  critical  aspect  that  requires  careful  thought,  planning,  analysis  and  actions  which  can  take  several  years.  It  is  also  through  President  Obama  and  his  supporters  that  the  health  care  bill,  legislation  to  curb  green  house  gases  and  improve  the  environment  passes,  preventing  a  second  great  depression  by  saving  three  large  car  manufacturers  from  going  out  of  business  and  which  would  have  possibly  leave  hundreds  or  thousands  without  jobs,  and  also  passed  the  largest  economic  stimulus  bill,  bringing  the  war  in  Iraq  to  an  end,  thus  saving  the  economy  a  lot  of  money  and  innocent  lives  from  being  taken,  nuclear  non-proliferation  movement,  repairing  our  image  abroad,  reversed  George  Bush's  ban  on  federal  funding  to  foreign  organizations  that  allows  abortion,  lifted  Bush's  ban  on  embryonic  stem  cell  research,  implementation  of  education  system  reform,  tobacco  regulation,  financial  industry  reformation,  appointing  two  Supreme  Court  Justices.  These  are  the  presidential  accomplishments  achieved  by  Obama  and  these  are  proof  that  the  president  is  determined  to  fullfill  his  promoses  he  had  first  made  to  the  nation.  Now,  it  is  our  turn  to  give  him  the  chance  he  need  to  do  so  and  give  him  some  more  time.[SEP]First  of  all,  he  has  had  several  years  to  fix  the  economy.  No  real  greenhouse  bills  have  been  passed,  they  have  accomplished  nothing  besides  increasing  spending.  Saving  the  car  companies  did  not  prevent  anything  and  he  basically  just  plugged  leaking  holes  in  corporations  that  will  never  work  due  to  the  extreme  wages  payed  to  workers.  The  war  in  Iraq  is  not  over.  Anyone  could  have  appointed  two  Justices  and  he  really  didn't  do  a  good  job  there  creating  the  biggest  controversy  in  the  history  of  the  Supreme  Court.  He  already  had  his  chance,  he  failed  at  basically  everything  he  said  he  would  do.  You  are  going  to  have  to  do  better  than  that  if  you  want  to  convince  anyone  he  did  a  "good  job"	1

No,  he  should  be  one  term  and  done  president.  What  has  he  done,  but  increase  the  national  debt?  He  ran  on  the  platform  that  he  was  going  to  create  more  jobs  to  stimulate  the  economy.  Well?  No,  he  has  been  in  the  office  for  over  2  years  now  and  I  really  don't  see  how  he  has  helped  the  american  people.  He  didn't  get  my  vote  in  2008  and  he  won't  get  in  in  2012  either.	1
look  obama  has  failed  the  american  people  from  these  few  examples    the  goverment  takeover  of  heathcare    failed  stimulus    outragous  spending  and  has  spent  more  then  georrge  bush  did  in  8  years  then  in  3      the  biggest  set  of  regulation  on  fincil  market    made  it  arder  for  americans  to  pay  their  enegry  bills    and  much  ,  much  more	1
No  his  plan  has  failed  miserably  no  reason  to  let  a  failure  stay  in  office.  But  let  me  point  out  that  yes  he  may  be  trying  his  best  but  he  still  failed.  America  has  never  had  a  president  that  was  out  to  destroy  the  nation,  he  sincerely  believes  in  what  he  is  doing  but  it  does  not  work.  Therefore  new  president.	1
no,  has  he  really  done  what  he  said  he  was  going  to  do?  to  some  extent,  but  not  the  way  he  promised	1
No.  Simply  said  he  is  a  horrible  president.  Boo  Obama.  He  hasn't  done  anything  good  for  us.	1
People  that  support  Obama,  either  support  the  NWO  or  don't  pay  attention  to  politics.	1
I  can  think  of  no  reason  to  re-elect  Obama  and  can  only  pray  that  the  Republican  Party  can  find  a  decent  candidate  to  run  against  him.	1

What  do  you  think  the  answer  would  be  if  you  asked  this  same  question  to  a  Muslim,  especially  one  living  in  the  Middle  East?

Absolutely  not.  He  has  not  done  one  thing  to  help  our  country  get  out  of  our  economic  woes,  he  has  not  displayed  ANY  leadership  throughout  the  debt  ceiling,  budget  debates,  or  congressional  issues,  he  ram-rodded  through  Congress  the  most  partisan  piece  of  legislation  this  nation  has  ever  seen  in  ObamaCare  while  at  the  same  time  calling  for  Republicans  to  embrace  bipartisanship,  and  is  sending  more  troops  to  Afghanistan  after  promising  to  take  them  out.      Get  him  out  of  there.	1
No.  Where  is  all  this  "change"  He's  promised  our  country.  Yes  it  takes  time  but  in  his  entire  time  in  office  our  country  has  NOT  changed  for  the  good  of  anyone  really.  Yeah  Obama  it  is  time  for  a  change.  Let's  start  by  taking  you  out  of  office.  One  of  the  good  things  he  did  was  his  speech  at  the  correspondents  dinner  in  April  when  he  shed  comedy  on  the  situation  with  his  birth  certificate.  One  of  the  only  times  a  politian  has  truely  made  me  laugh  from  wit  and  cleverness.	1
A  jobless  economic  recovery.....unemployment  numbers  going  up  not  down.    When  he  took  office  all  he  cared  about  was  the  Health  Care  issue...he  concentrated  on  that....which  today  is  a  fiasco  and  the  American  people  do  not  want  it.      He  said  war  would  end  troops  will  come  home.  He  lied.  Now  he  is  pledging  that  they  come  home  a  year  from  September....wow  two  months  from  ELECTION.  He  is  a  master  manipulator.    He  never  delivered  the  positive  change  he  promised.  His  change  is  NOT  what  the  American  people  expected  and  wanted.      He  has  a  socialist  vision  for  America  and  has  employed  socialist  czars  to  carry  it  out.  Look  at  the  list  of  self  confessed  socialist  friends  he  has  and  has  appointed.	1

Obama  is  the  nutball.  He  is  a  liar.      Now  I  don't  know  where  you  are  from...but  if  you  are  an  American...I  will  personally  pay  for  a  ONE  WAY  TICKET  just  for  you  if  agree  to  leave  the  country  and  NEVER  COME  BACK.  Then  you  can  live  in  one  of  those  perfect  countries  that  rely  on  America  to  come  to  their  defense  every  time  something  happens.  Yes,  go  live  in  Iraq  where  there  are  no  atrocities  and  where  you  can  enjoy  freedom  to  say  whatever  you  want.  Go  to  a  country  where  you  can't  own  a  gun...to  defend  yourself.      I  tell  ya  people  like  you  make  my  stomach  turn....you  bash  America  and  would  be  the  first  one  to  hide  behind  one  of  our  servicemen  if  we  were  attacked.  You  obviously  love  Obama....tell  me,  has  he  BROUGHT  ALL  THE  TROOPS  HOME  LIKE  HE  PROMISED?  Is  American  presence  gone  from  the  Middle  East,  like  he  said  would  happen?  Gun  toting?  Didn't  Obama  join  in  on  the  attack  against  Libya?  Who  was  totin  a  gun  then  skippy?    All  the  men  and  women  who  have  died  since  he  took  over  president  he  is  responsible  for.  The  blood  is  on  HIS  HANDS  NOW.  Where  are  those  outspoken  democrats  who  voted  for  him  because  they  were  told,  no  promised,  that  he  would  END  THE  WAR?	1
Obama  was  just  lucky  he  got  osama.  And  he  made  the  country  drowning  in  dept  and  lost  lost  a  huge  number  of  jobs.  And  the  cost  of  fuel  is  high  because  of  his  huge  tax  on  oil.	1
Did  anyone  know  that  or  joke  for  a  president  has  got  us  into  more  debt  in  3  years  than  bush  did  in  8?  All  democraps  give  this  arguement  about  usama:  Obama  got  him.  Ok  well  why  did  it  take  him  over  16  hours  to  say  "go  get  him"  when  he  knew  that  they  could  immediatley  and  they  were  waiting  for  a  command?  He  is  destroying  our  country  inside  and  out  and  you  democraps  are  defending  him?  how  stupid  can  you  get!  CUT  spending,  CAP  debt  and  balance  the  damn  budget  why  is  that  so  freakin  hard  to  understand!?  FORGET  THE  DEBT  CEILING!  whats  the  point  in  having  a  freakin  limit  if  all  your  gonna  do  is  raise  it?  How  is  spending  more  money  going  to  help  our  debt  that  makes  NOOO  sense  and  dems  will  say  "we  will  go  bankrupt"  HELLO  we  have  been  pretty  much  with  over  14  trillion  dollars  in  debt!  Jobs?  give  me  a  break  the  only  jobs  obama  baby  has  made  is  for  the  freakin  foreigners,  hell  they  have  more  freakin  rights  than  we  do!  they  get  our  jobs  but  they  dont  have  to  speak  english?  However  a  real  American  looking  for  work  can't  get  one  because.....why?  Ronald  Reagan  restored  America's  honor  after  Carter,  who  will  after  obama?	1
He  hasn't  C.H.A.N.G.E.D.  our  country  at  all!!!  We  are  stuck  in  a  crappy  position  and  our  economy  is  sinking!!!  We  are  in  trouble  and  Obama  hasn't  done  what  he  promised  to  do.  Plain  and  simple.  End  of  story.	1
Did  anyone  know  that  or  joke  for  a  president  has  got  us  into  more  debt  in  3  years  than  bush  did  in  8?  I  don't  think  he  should  be  re-elected  because  look  at  what  he  has  done  to  this  country.  He  has  made  it  worse  and  if  he  does  get  re-elected  he  will  make  the  country  even  worst  than  it  all  ready  is.  So  no  he  should  no  get  re-elected.he  can  try  to  get  a  new  job  and  not  try  to  ruin  our  country.  My  teacher  said  the  Congress  is  making  all  the  laws  but  he  is  telling  them  to  do  the  laws.  he  is  just  giving  out  money  like  it  grows  on  trees.  like  when  he  wanted  to  rebuild  the  old  schools  like  my  school  (K.O.  KNUDSON)  and  he  wanted  to  rebuild  Bridges  across  ed  the  states.Yes  he  got  elected  for  many  reasons.  He  campaigned  on  lies...He  made  promises  he  did  not  keep  and  we  are  not  a  stupid  people....we  can  see  him  today  a  different  person.  he  wanted  change....we  got  it.  And  the  majority  of  the  population  do  not  support  him  any  longer.  We  do  not  want  same  sex  marriage,  we  do  not  want  his  health  care  package,  we  do  not  want  his  socialist  ideals  governing  us.  He  was  elected  because  he  was  half  black.  Millions  of  people  voted  color  and  had  no  idea  what  he  was  all  about.  We  have  many  capable  blacks  in  our  country  who  had  experience  who  would  have  made  a  great  president....Obama  was  not  the  right  person  for  the  job.  He  duped  and  succeeded  in  convincing  the  country  he  was  someone  else.  He  still  has  not  released  his  school  or  medical  records....Why?  He  just  now  came  forward  with  some  new  birth  certificate....all  of  a  sudden....why  not  back  during  the  campaign?  But  people  who  voted  for  him  did  not  care  about  his  views.  This  is  hilarious  and  shows  exactly  how  and  why  he  got  elected.  This  was  only  one  segment  of  the  population  exposed.	1
When  a  leader  makes  promises  and  fails  to  keep  them,  he  should  not  be  reelected.  Obama  claimed  that  if  he  failed  to  turn  the  economy  around  by  the  end  of  his  first  term,  he  would  not  run  again.  The  economy  has  continued  to  flounder,  yet  Obama  now  seeks  reelection.  His  charm  and  speaking  ability  is  undeniable,  yet  so  are  his  inadequacies  as  President  of  the  United  States.	1
More  and  more  government  isn't  the  solution.  As  we  can  see  already,  this  is  the  case.  America  needs  to  stop  the  hair  of  the  dog  spending  and  consumerism,  and  start  savings  and  investing.	1
No,  he  is  a  scam.  He  can't  even  do  things  straight  and  is  full  of  pride.  He  can't  admit  that  he  is  wrong  when  he  is.    I  also  love  how  he's  spent  millions  on  his  family  vacations.  Oh,  and  the  what  is  it?  40  personal  maids  the  first  lady  has?  What  a  black  bimbo.	1
Was  has  he  done  that  is  beneficial?  His  "Jobs  Plan"  covers  about  four  months  of  our  countries  debt.  -_-  he  sucks	1

Cheney  and  Halliburton,  anyone  associated  with  Jack  Abramoff,  Enron,  Carl  Brizi  and  Tim  Durham,  the  list  goes  on  and  on.  And  on  and  on.  Are  there  any  democrats  with  ties  to  big  business?  You  bet  there  are.  The  difference  is  that  democrats,  as  a  body,  donât  seek  to  exploit  their  elected  positions  by  introducing  and  voting  for  legislation  to  enhance  their  personal  finances  and  power.      Cons  romance  the  voters  in  the  religious  right,  and  then  do  next  to  nothing  to  advance  that  agenda.  They  appeal  to  the  fears  of  the  frightened,  even  going  so  far  as  to  manufacture  fear  in  order  to  do  so.  They  court  the  angry  disenfranchised  middle  class  white  voters  with  tales  of  welfare  fraud  and  reverse  racism.  They  lie  to  those  that  are  self-interested,  but  not  completely  without  a  sense  of  patriotism  or  concern  for  their  fellow  citizens  â  they  help  them  to  believe  that  lowering  taxes  for  the  rich,  deregulating  business  and  cutting  social  programs  is  good  for  our  economy.      Would  Rush  Limbaugh,  a  multi-millionaire,  have  any  reason  to  have  voters  believe  that  the  rich  should  have  a  lower  tax  burden?  Would  Dick  Cheney,  who  is  a  major  stockholder  in  many  corporations  and  sits  on  the  board  for  several,  have  any  reason  whatsoever  to  have  the  voting  public  believe  that  business  should  be  free  of  regulations,  thereby  increasing  profit  shares?      Consider  the  source,  and  then  investigate  the  evidence,  check  the  historic  precedence  and  then  ask  yourself  who  stands  to  gain?      The  Tea  Party  crowd  idolizes  the  Americaâs  Founders  along  with  todayâs  corporate  titans,  whose  taxes  must  be  kept  low  so  they  can  be  the  great  âjob  creators.â  But  the  contrast  is  striking,  since  the  Founders  risked  everything  for  the  country  while  todayâs  rich  wonât  even  take  the  chance  of  hiring  some  extra  workers,  Michael  Winship  writes.      Todayâs  corporate  giants,  blinded  by  greed,  oblivious  to  the  despair  around  them,  are  doing  much  the  same.  `  Conservative  screenwriter  Lionel  Chetwynd  scripted  the  introductory  film  at  the  siteâs  orientation  center.  And  Sarah  Palin  paid  a  visit  during  her  recent  bus  tour,  just  a  couple  of  weeks  before  our  arrival,  writing  on  her  website  that  daughter  Piper  mentioned  to  her  how  hard  Washington  must  have  worked  âto  keep  that  farm  going.â    Stephen  Colbert  responded,  âItâs  true.  I  cannot  imagine  how  hard  he  worked,  with  no  help  other  than  his  African  volunteers.â  The  Fortune  500  generated  nearly  $10.8  trillion  in  total  revenues  last  year,  up  10.5%.  Total  profits  soared  81%.  But  guess  who  didnât  benefit  much  from  this  giant  wave  of  cash?  Millions  of  U.S.  workers  stuck  mired  in  a  stagnant  job  market.  â¦  Weâve  rarely  seen  such  a  stark  gulf  between  the  fortunes  of  the  500  and  those  of  ordinary  Americans.â  Hypocrites,  because  their  radical  free  market  ideology,  and  the  resulting  total  deregulation  of  the  financial  markets,  is  what  caused  the  debt  to  spiral  out  of  control  this  last  decade.  That  and  the  wars  George  W.  Bush  launched  but  didnât  have  the  integrity  to  responsibly  finance.  The  consequence  was  a  banking  bubble  and  crash  leading  to  a  50  percent  run-up  of  the  debt  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  âentitlementsâ  that  those  same  Republicans  have  always  wanted  to  destroy.  again  according  to  Erickson,  were  giving  it  plenty  of  credence.  In  an  âopen  letterâ  to  Congressional  Republicans  he  wrote,  âdespite  what  the  pundits  in  Washington  are  telling  you,  it  is  you  and  not  Obama  who  hold  most  of  the  cards...Should  the  United  States  lose  its  bond  rating,  it  will  be  called  the  'Obama  Depression.'  Congress  does  not  get  pinned  with  this  stuff.â      the  United  States  Senate  issuing  the  LevinâCoburn  Report  found  âthat  the  crisis  was  not  a  natural  disaster,  but  the  result  of  high  risk,  complex  financial  products;  undisclosed  conflicts  of  interest;  and  the  failure  of  regulators,  the  credit  rating  agencies,  and  the  market  itself  to  rein  in  the  excesses  of  Wall  Street.â[10][11]  Critics  argued  that  credit  rating  agencies  and  investors  failed  to  accurately  price  the  risk  involved  with  mortgage-related  financial  products,  and  that  governments  did  not  adjust  their  regulatory  practices  to  address  21st-century  financial  markets.[12]  The  repeal  of  the  GlassâSteagall  Act  of  1933  effectively  removed  the  separation  that  previously  existed  between  Wall  Street  investment  banks  and  depository  banks.  There  is  some  debate  as  to  what  role  the  repeal  of  GlassâSteagall  had  on  the  late  2000s  financial  crisis.[13]  In  response  to  the  financial  crisis,  both  market-based  and  regulatory  solutions  have  been  implemented  or  are  under  consideration.[14]    Consider  the  terrible  consequences  of  the  'anything  goes'  Bush  Administration,  whose  irresponsible  non-regulation  of  financial  institutions  has  led  to  this  crisis."    George  W  Bush  -  that  in  the  eight  years  of  his  presidency  he  actively  pursued  policies  of  deregulation  which  caused  the  biggest  financial  and  economic  meltdown  since  the  Great  Depression.      He  certainly  presided  over  a  widespread  failure  of  regulation.    On  his  watch,  the  US  authorities  did  little  to  prevent  the  sale  of  millions  of  mortgages  to  people  who  could  never  afford  them.    They  failed  to  police  the  market  in  mortgage-backed  securities  which  has  now  collapsed  with  such  devastating  consequences.    And  credit  default  swaps,  those  multi-billion-dollar  bets  on  other  people  going  bust,  went  virtually  unregulated.    In  recent  days,  Congress  has  been  holding  hearings  to  determine  how  the  regulators  at  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  missed  numerous  warning  signs  -  "Red  Flags"  -  about  Bernard  Madoff,  the  man  accused  of  running  a  gigantic  Ponzi  scheme  which  has  defrauded  investors  of  at  least  $50bn.      Deregulation  started  long  before  President  Bush  came  to  power,  and  it  was  enthusiastically  pursued  by  both  Democratic  and  Republican  administrations.    Here  is  just  one  example:    The  Glass-Steagall  Act  of  1933  separated  the  activities  of  commercial  banks,  which  take  deposits,  from  investment  banks,  which  invest  money.  It  was  repealed  in  1999.    That  relaxation  of  the  rules  enabled  commercial  lenders,  like  Citigroup,  to  trade  instruments  such  as  mortgage-backed  securities  and  collateralised  debt  obligations.	0

More  and  more  government  isn't  the  solution.  As  we  can  see  already,  this  is  the  case.  America  needs  to  stop  the  hair  of  the  dog  spending  and  consumerism,  and  start  savings  and  investing.[SEP]That's  an  interesting  thought--"and  start  savings  and  investing."  Care  to  expand  on  that?  I've  never  taken  a  formal  course  on  economics,  and  the  idea  of  a  nation    investing    never  occurred  to  me  as  anything  realistic...could  that  actually  work?      Still,  though,  the  government  serves  a  number  of  really  important  functions,  like  education  and  maintaining  infrastructure.

As  a  general  rule,  downvoting  should  probably  not  get  people's  panties  in  a  twist,  but  then  again...    Downvoting  without  a  rebuttal  is  generally  seen  as  cowardice.  Indeed,  if  you  want  your  side  to  win,  why  not  downvote  (losing  a  point  for  that  side,  but  also  yourself)  and  then  provide  a  point  of  your  own  in  dispute  (adding  a  point  to  your  side,  and  gaining  one  for  yourself)...of  course  that  point  itself  may  be  a  target  for  downvoting,  but  if  you  have  said  something  worthwhile  in  rebuttal,  you  have  no  reason  to  worry,  right?	1

A  downvote  seems  to  represent  a  disfavor  in  how  the  argument  was  presented,  meaning  that  if  you  downvote  without  giving  a  good  argument,  that  makes  you  an  asshole.	0

More  and  more  government  isn't  the  solution.  As  we  can  see  already,  this  is  the  case.  America  needs  to  stop  the  hair  of  the  dog  spending  and  consumerism,  and  start  savings  and  investing.[SEP]That's  an  interesting  thought--"and  start  savings  and  investing."  Care  to  expand  on  that?  I've  never  taken  a  formal  course  on  economics,  and  the  idea  of  a  nation    investing    never  occurred  to  me  as  anything  realistic...could  that  actually  work?      Still,  though,  the  government  serves  a  number  of  really  important  functions,  like  education  and  maintaining  infrastructure.  I'm  not  sure  how  much  more  spending  it  can  cut  without  harming  the  public--we're  already  seeing  huge  cuts  to  education...[SEP]Education  should  be  cut  all  together.  It's  not  the  government's  job  to  care  for  our  kids.  It  is  ours.  We  should  ether  home  school  them,  or  send  them  to  privet  school.  We  can  cut  trillions  more.	1

Compared  to  losing  thousands  of  jobs,  losing  billions  in  personal  and  corporate  tax  revenue,  and  spending  billions  in  welfare  to  support  unemployed  workers.      Considering  that  you  are  only  looking  at  what  is  seen  and  not  unseen.  However,  Ford  maybe  part  of  the  unseen  considering  it  didn't  take  a  bailout,  and  it  is  still  in  business.    Losing  of  jobs  would  have  been  lost,  but  if  an  adjustable  and  corrective  market,  these  people  would  have  adapted.    As  aforementioned,  this  $14  billion  dollars  is  only  estimates  done  by  government,  and  government  lie  to  fit  thier  agenda.      So,  the  real  cost  of  the  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac  bailouts  demonstrate  this.    A  recent  study  from  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  (CBO)  has  zero  credibility.  It  pegged  likely  taxpayer  losses  in  the  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac  bailouts  at  $25  billion.  For  those  with  a  sense  of  history,  it  is  worth  remembering  that  the  S&L;bailout  had  a  $160  billion  price  tag.  The  numbers  diverge  so  far  from  reality  as  to  be  laugh-out-loud  funny.  Funny,  that  is,  except  that  the  CBO  estimate  demonstrates  a  willful  disconnect  with  the  actual  consequences  of  federal  government  actions.    As  demonstrated  below,  the  real  cost  of  the  bailouts  will  easily  exceed  $1.3  trillion.  In  fact,  the  real  cost  is  likely  to  range  between  $1.3  trillion  to  $1.6  trillion,  and  is  not  unlikely  to  reach  $2.5  trillion.      Our  only  hope  is  to  (1)  accept  up  front  a  twenty-percent  fall  in  American  living  standards  for  a  people  living  beyond  their  means  for  the  past  twenty-five  years  on  the  delusions  made  possible  by  fiat  money,  and  (2)  simultaneously  discipline  the  creature  from  Jekyll  Island,  a.k.a.  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  not  to  create  new  money  just  to  prop  up  asset-price  bubbles.  Mises        Ask  Ford  who  didn't  even  take  a  bailout  if  it  was  worth  it  (in  the  story  you  linked  to)  to  preserve  the  market  and  their  supplier  base,  etc.      The  CEO  of  Ford  doesn't  even  understand  that  his  own  company  one  who  didn't  take  the  bailout  is  still  in  business  because  of  good  past  decisions.      Then  why  wouldn't  Bush  claim  the  credit?  and  how  was  he  releasing  videos  discussing  current  events?      None  of  which  are  actually  links  to  any  substantial  evidence  that  he  was  still  live.      and  mandate  coverage  for  the  sick,  increased  access  to  preventative  care,  help  prevent/detect  fraud,  stop  rescissions  of  insurance  when  insurance  companies  find  out  your  sick,  etc.      Which  is  the  reasons  for  double  for  less  coverage,  worse  outcomes  and  medical  bills  that  contributed  to  bankruptcies.      This  plan  is  not  a  single  payer  government  run  plan  like  medicare  -  it  sets  the  rules  of  the  road  and  then  lets  companies  compete      Actually,  that  is  the  eventual  plan  because  in  order  to  crowd  out  business,  government  first  regulates  it  to  death,  then  the  whole  economies  of  scale  and  natural  monopoly  come  abroad,  then  government  takes  over.    By  the  way,  the  article  didn't  work.	1

I  guess  you've  never  seen  the  O'Reilly  Factor.    But  anyway:    "Save  the  auto  industry"    We  can  debate  the  numbers,  but  you're  not  about  that  (clearly).  So  let's  talk  about  the  ideology  of  saving  the  auto  industry.  Or  even  better,  simplify:  Added  to  the  Corporatist  system  of  the  United  States.  Same  with  bailing  out  the  banks.  And  for  shame...  I  thought  you  didn't  like  the  corporations  and  all  their  money.  Finally,  they  have  a  chance  to  fail  and  leave  their  business  to  bidders,  and  you  support  the  legislation  that  keeps  them  "too  big  to  fail".      "Finally  brave  enough  to  fix  our  ridiculous  health  care  system".    Ridiculous  indeed.  We  waste  billions  on  medicare  and  medicaid,  just  to  see  that  they  are,  in  general,  pathetic  ways  to  help  those  in  need.  I  don't  disagree  with  you  on  that  one.  My  problem  is  1.  Brave...  like  all  the  other  presidents  who  were  "finally  brave  enough"  to  do  something  about  the  healthcare  system?  INCLUDING  BUSH!  2.  Government  hospitals  and  Universal  Health-care...  right,  because  government  healthcare  worked  in  this  country  all  this  time...  oh  wait,  our  health  care  system  is  ridiculous.  Darn  these  intricate  fallacies.  BUT  WAIT!!!!  A  voucher  program,  proposed  by  Paul  Ryan,  implying  that  government  will  continue  to  help  people  who  are  in  need  of  medical  care  but  can't  afford  it,  but  instead  of  choosing  what  kind  of  treatment  the  people  will  receive,  they  will  be  able  to  choose  their  coverage  in  the  private  sector.  This  is  far  better  than  subsidizing  for  subsidizing  takes  away  incentive  to  compete  and  provide  better  coverage.  But  with  the  voucher  program,  the  private  sector  will  continue  to  compete  for  the  only  way  for  them  to  receive  that  money  is  if  the  people  find  them  a  suitable  insurer.  But  that's  too  sensible,  right?  Nope,  let's  just  get  government  more  involved  with  running  the  healthcare  system,  because  if  cotton  rips  all  the  time,  the  only  solution  is  MOAR  cotton.    But  another  thing  we  can  agree  on,  the  Republican  nominees  are  looking  shitty.  Gary  Johnson  and  Ron  Paul  will  most  likely  not  get  it,  and  Paul  Ryan  is  dicking  around.	1

Jeez  I  hope  Palin  runs,  that  would  be  hilarious.[SEP]Hey  stupid  he  helped  the  auto  industry  with  TAXPAYERS  DOLLARS!  HELLLLOOOOO?  and  thats  helping  the  American  people  how?  Chrysler  will  never  pay  it  back  in  our  lifetimes.  Seriously  you  make  NO  sense!	1
Let's  see,    Saved  the  auto  industry,    Got  Osama  in  2.5  years  after  the  last  republican  couldn't  in  nearly  7,    Jobs  and  GDP  have  increased  consistently  every  month  he's  been  president,  while  they  both  had  decreased  every  single  month  just  about  for  nearly  7  years  before  he  was  elected.    Plus  a  president  finally  brave  enough  to  fix  our  ridiculous  health  care  system.    Besides,  Republicans  are  too  puritan  and  uneducated  at  their  base  to  elect  anyone  who  has  even  a  passive  chance  of  beating  Obama  this  time  around.  You're  going  end  up  with  a  nominee  who  thinks  Adam  and  Eve  ran  around  with  dinosaurs,  thinks  global  warming  is  a  hoax,  and  won't  be  able  to  answer  a  single  substance  question  unless  it's  on  Fox  and  they  are  given  the  script  beforehand.    Republicans  really  don't  have  a  chance  this  time,  and  after  the  silliness  in  Wisconsin  Dems  have  a  really  good  chance  of  taking  back  the  House  as  well.

Supposing  we  find  one,  just  give  it  time.  All  politicians  lie,  why  are  you  acting  like  this  is  something  new?  However  to  say  that  he  has  never  made  any  accomplishments  while  in  office,  I  think  is  quite  false.

He  has  been  trying  to  bridge  the  huge  gap  between  the  republicans  and  democrats  and  yet  all  of  the  republicans  still  find  fault  with  him.

Obamaâs  greatest  achievementâ¦writing  books  about  guess  who?  Barack  Obama.  He  is  a  master  manipulator  and  lied  before  the  election  and  continues  to  do  that  today.  He  never  would  come  clean  about  birth  certificate  until  Trump  went  after  himâ¦then  all  of  a  sudden  one  pops  up.  ????  Was  he  really  born  in  America?          He  consistently  lied  about  the  war.  In  2008  after  the  Democratic  convention  he  stated  that  we  had  an  âabsolute  obligationâ  to  stay  in  Iraq  that  it  would  be  a  disservice  to  all  who  lost  their  lives  there.  âThe  failure  of  the  Iraqi  state  would  be  a  disaster,â  he  said  at  a  lunch  sponsored  by  the  Christian  Science  Monitor.  âIt  would  dishonor  the  900-plus  men  and  women  who  have  already  died.  .  .  .  It  would  be  a  betrayal  of  the  promise  that  we  made  to  the  Iraqi  people,  and  it  would  be  hugely  destabilizing  from  a  national  security  perspective.â  Yet  he  took  a  different  stance  while  campaigning.  He  said  one  of  the  first  things  he  would  do  would  be  to  bring  all  the  troops  home  and  end  the  war.  We  all  know  thatâ¦that  did  not  happen.    Is  he,  was  he  ever  a  Muslim?  Wellâ¦â¦he  would  like  you  to  believe  that  he  was  notâ¦but  he  has  given  many  different  answers  to  this  question.  Was  he  a  constitutional  law  professor?  He  stated  that  he  was  and  thatâs  why  he  knew  the  law  better  than  Bush.  That  was  a  lie  however  as  he  was  only  a  senior  lecturer.      He  canât  give  a  speech  (with  or  without  a  teleprompter)  and  when  he  does  its  full  of  errors.  Remember  the  Kansas  tornado  tragedy?  He  stated  for  the  record  that  over  10,000  people  died  that  an  entire  town  was  destroyed.  Actually  the  town  was  ok  and  only  12  died.      He  canât  figure  out  whether  he  is  for  decriminalizing  pot  or  against  it.  He  says  what  the  audience  wants  to  hear  and  did  that  to  get  votes.  In  a  presidential  debate  he  sided  with  most  the  other  Demosâ¦said  he  was  against  it.  BUT  later  in  a  speech  in  Illinois  to  college  students  he  said  the  opposite  as  he  did  in  a  debate  at  Northwestern  University.    He  lied  about  his  pastor  Rev.  Wright  (uncle  to  him,  who  baptized  him  and  Michele  and  just  happens  to  be  godfather  to  his  girls)â¦.he  never  heard  all  those  anti-white  speeches,  not  a  one.      And  then  there  is  Tony  Rezkoâ¦..and  Bill  Ayers,  Bernadine  Dohrnâ¦.and  his  staff  who  are  self  admitted  socialists.          He  said  he  never  took  a  dime  from  a  Washington  lobbyist.  Lie  he  did.      http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/  election2008/2008-04-15-obama_N.htm        Then  he  lied  about  tax  cutsâ¦.denies  attacking  small  businessesâ¦â¦all  while  he  was  raking  in  money,  political  contributions  from  those  associated  with  Fannie  and  Freddie.          Tell  me  what  he  has  ever  done  for  the  middle  class?          He  hates  Israel.  Gee  I  wonder  why?  Maybe  because  he  bowed  to  a  Saudi  King,  maybe  because  he  studied  the  Koran  when  he  attended  Islamic  schoolsâ¦.oh  yes  thatâs  right  he  is  Christian.      He  sure  did  not  learn  history  at  Harvard.  He  has  no  idea  how  many  states  there  are  in  the  United  States  where  he  just  happens  to  be  commander  in  chief.

He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.	0

Yeah  that  legislation  is  working  great  now  that  the  housing  market  is  out  of  the  economic  trough.  OHH  wait,  it  isn't.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?  That's  recklessly  irresponsible  unnecessary  spending.	1

Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?  That's  recklessly  irresponsible  unnecessary  spending.	1
He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]You  mean  economics  books  like  this  one?      http://books.google.com/  books?id=TPa22fYkDSsC&pg;=PA436&dq;=eco  nomics+text+bubble&lr;=&as;_brr=0&as;_  pt=BOOKS&cd;=2#v=onepage&q;=economics%2  0text%20bubble&f;=false        Or  maybe  this  one?      http://books.google.com/  books?id=nUWOUrMDQPEC&pg;=PA9&dq;=econo  mics+text+bubble&lr;=&as;_brr=0&as;_  pt=BOOKS&cd;=15#v=onepage&q;=economics%  20text%20bubble&f;=false        Possibly  this  one?      http://books.google.com/  books?id=dpTBdNGGrtUC&pg;=PA281&dq;=eco  nomics+text+bubble&lr;=&as;_brr=0&as;_  pt=BOOKS&cd;=30#v=onepage&q;=bubble&f;=  false        Want  to  dig  that  hole  any  deeper  or  are  you  good  where  you  are?    "Some  public  institutions".  I  like  that.  It's  suitably  vague  that  you  can  completely  cover  your  backside.  How  about  we  try  pinning  you  down  a  little  bit  though.    Medicare?  Is  that  a  public  institution  that  counts?  Or  do  you  want  to  tell  the  entire  senior  population  of  the  United  states  they're  on  thier  own  for  health  insurance?    Social  Security?  How  about  that  one?    Transportation?  Do  you  like  interstates  and  air  traffic  control?    Regulatory  institutions?  Should  we  just  let  Wall  Street  do  ANYTHING  it  wants?  Because  letting  them  do  most  of  what  they  wanted  has  been  working  out    awesomely  ...    And  genius,  I  am  not  only  wilingl  to  but  AM  paying  for  all  of  my  house.  If  the  government  wants  to  give  me  a  tax  break  for  purchasing  it  I'm  not  telling  them  no  though.  And  I  have  consistently,  throughout  my  entire  life,  said  that  tax  rates  are  too  low  and  should  be  raised.  And  yes,  that  includes  on  me.  I  have  never  lobbied  any  representative  to  try  to  lower  my  taxes  because  I  am  a  grown-up  who  knows  that  we  DO  actually  have  to  pay  for  things  we  ask  the  government  to  provide.  I  make  quite  enough  money  to  comfortably  support  myself  and  also  pay  my  fair  share  to  support  the  government  institutions  that  keep  the  nation  running  and  don't  need  to  throw  a  childish  tantrum  just  because  I'm  expected  to  contribute.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.

My  favorite  is  Free  to  Choose  by  Milton  Friedman.  Sorry  I  guess  that  I  don't  have  a  PhD  in  economics  like  you  do.  What  hole?  You  are  in  the  hole.    Since  you  are  an  expert  on  economic  bubbles,  please  grant  me  your  expertise  on  what  a  bubble  is.    Oh  wait.  I  already  know.    An  economic  bubble  is  commonly  used  term  to  describe  an  economic  or  business  cycle  that  is  best  characterized  by  the  rapid  expansion  followed  by  the  contraction  in  a  economy  often  times  in  dramatic  fashion.        I  am  pretty  sure  that  I  said  that  before  because  I  explained  it  in  a  previous  statement.  "Economic  trough  is  consequence  of  a  business  cycle  after  there  was  a  peak  in  expansion.  Many  areas  of  the  nation  experienced  double-digit-percent  declines  in  house  prices  where  they  peaked  in  expansion  and  dipped  to  a  trough  in  contraction."    Pin  me  down.  OK,  I  can  handle  it.    Medicare.  Sure.  I  don't  want  to  see  your  grandmother  die  because  no  insurance.    Medicaid  on  the  other  hand.  No.  Able  people,  they  should  pay  for  their  own  health  insurance.  I  shouldn't  have  to  pay  so  they  can  be  subsidized  at  discounted  rates.    Regulatory  Institutions.  You  said,  Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  Financial  regulations  on  Wall  Street  is  the  government  telling  people  what  they  can  do  with  their  money  and  how  they  chose  to  invest  or  gamble.    If  you  believe  that  your  tax  rates  are  too  low,  then  write  OUT  A  CHECK  FOR  MORE  MONEY.  The  IRS  WOULD  GLADLY  ACCEPT  THAT  MONEY.  Tax  laws  are  only  what  is  minimally  required  to  pay.  There  is  no  maximum.    Social  Security  includes  unemployment  benefits.  So,  if  the  government  didn't  tax  our  wages  for  unemployment  benefits,  that  extra  money  people  earn  without  the  tax,  they  could  save  that  money  instead  getting  unemployment  benefits  if  they  are  unemployed.  As  for  veterans  and  disabilities,  sure  they  are  entitled  to  social  security.  They  both  earned  it.        we  DO  actually  have  to  pay  for  things  we  ask  the  government  to  provide    that  is  why  we  have  a  1.3  trillion  dollar  deficit  and  a  12  trillion  dollar  debt.  Yeah,  I  guess  we  do  pay  things  we  ask  for  the  government.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.

Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?

He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]Well,  I  edited  it  so  that  it  is  even  more  coherent.  I  was  in  a  hurry  at  the  time.--------------[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.

He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.

I  don't  vote,  but  I  would  probably  support  Obama  in  2012.  Unless  a  better  candidate  comes  up,  and  looking  at  the  republican  party  history  the  last  decade  or  so,  it  doesn't  fill  me  with  confidence.    Besides,  Obama  makes  the  crazies  scream  and  cry,  and  nothing  gives  me  a  greater  smile  than  reading  the  comments  of  nutjobs  who  think  Jesus  is  coming  soon  because  Obama  is  the  antichrist,  and  their  dismay  at  insurance  reform.	0

Yes.    I  just  love  the  fact  that  there's  somebody  mixed  race  heading  a  racist  country.    For  that  one  reason  I  would  vote  for  him.    If  he  does  well  for  the  country  -  good  on  him  and  maybe  people  will  realise  it.    If  he  turns  America  into  a  hell  hole  -  good  on  him...  I  hate  Americunts  :)[SEP]Being  american,  I  was  very  happy  to  read  that.  No  one  directly  talks  about  how  bad  americans  can  be  in  this  country,  partly  due  to  our  self-richeousness.  Thank  you!	0
Hell  no!  His  policies  are  crap  and  I  can't  wait  for  the  courts  to  overturn  his  health  care  bill  crap  ;)	1
He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?	0

Paying  750  per  year  is  more  than  the  uninsured  are  putting  into  the  system  now,  so  it  is  better.    2.

Just  about  everyone    wants    insurance,  again,  it  is  not  an  issue  of  "personal  freedom"  and  if  you've  let  the  trillion  dollar  insurance  industry  trick  you  into  thinking  that  you've  been  duped.    3.  It's  absolutely  nothing  like  your  example  of  homeowners  insurance,  and  I  think  you  know  that.  As  you  keep  complaining  the  situation  is  more  like  making  homeowner  insurance  mandatory  for  everyone,  thus  lowering  the  cost  for  everyone,  thus  if  the  house  does  catch  on  fire  your  life  isn't  ruined  and  you  do  not  become  a  burden  on  society.    4.  I  find  the  assumption  that  only  the  "irresponsible"  don't  have  insurance  very  offensive.  The  vast  majority  of  the  uninsured  work  full  time  jobs  but  cannot  afford  it.    5.  Only  the  healthy  think  their  insurance  is  any  good.  There  is  a  very  high  possibility  that  before  this  bill  was  passed,  if  you  were  seriously  ill  your  insurance  would  have  found  a  reason  not  to  cover  or  to  only  cover  a  portion.

Again,  like  I've  explained  to  Joe  a  hundred  times,  the  only  way    your    insurance  is  going  to  change  if  you  are  already  insured  is  it  will  be  less  expensive,  you  will  get  rebates  if  85%  of  the  money  you  pay  hasn't  been  used  for  health  reasons,  and  your  insurance  won't  be  allowed  to  look  for  ways  to  not  cover  you  because  of  "pre-existing"  conditions.    All  this  fear  rhetoric  running  amok,  I  haven't  seen  a  single  piece  of  evidence  any  of  it  is  founded.

There  is  no  real  life  example  that  says  otherwise.[SEP]I'm  going  to  address  these  concerns  starting  with  your  last  point:    5.  When  speaking  of  fear  rhetoric,  I'm  not  talking  about  your  argument  specifically,  but  all  of  the  death  panel  BS  and  socialist  take-over  nonsense  the  tea-baggers  spew,  whom  consequently  make  up  the  majority  of  the  opposition  and  all  of  the  death  threats,  bricks  through  windows,  etc.    The  1.05  trillion  dollar  price  tag  is  nominal,  but  not  that  nominal.  They  are  pretty  sure  it  will  be  between  1  trillion  and  1.5  trillion...    over  ten  years.    That  is  less  money  than  one  year  of  the  Iraq  war  and  instead  of  killing  people  we  are  saving  them.    4.  That  simply  is  not  true.  Rationing  should  only  exist  when  resources  are  limited,  however  the  difference  is,  the  insurance  industry  has  had  plenty  of  resources.  In  fact  even  in  this  economy  they  have  continued  turning  out  record  profits  while  at  the  same  time  covering  less  people.  Since  we  didn't  go  with  the  single  payer  system  for  some  mysterious  reason,  the  next  best  thing  is  to  legally  demand  the  private  companies  we  will  still  be  getting  our  insurance  from  are  legally  obligated  to  insure.    I  don't  doubt  they  will  still  find  ways  to  let  people  die  for  a  profit,  but  at  least  it  will  be  harder  for  them  to  do.    3.  Sounds  like  propaganda,  no  offense.  They    say    they  will  have  to  raise  rates,  but  I  don't  believe  them.  They  may    want    to  raise  rates,  but  they  won't  be  allowed  to  because  now  they  must  spend  85%  of  the  money  they  receive  directly  on  healthcare  or  they  will  lose  their  license  to  provide  insurance.  My  guess  is  they  will  actually  be  forced  to  lower  rates  since  only  something  like  10%  goes  toward  actual  healthcare  now.    2.  It  is  hard  to  argue,  and  some  I'm  sure  really  do  have  good  insurance.  But  again,  the  majority  of  these  bankruptcies  are  people  who    thought    they  had  good  insurance.  The  trend  seems  show  the  comment  to  be  correct.    1.  You  cover  a  lot  ground  with  this  comment.  First  I  believe  you  have  an  unfair  negative  view  of  mandates.  For  example  government  mandates  hospitals  maintain  a  minimum  standard  of  cleanliness,  as  a  result  things  like  the  black  plague  are  far  less  common.  Could  there  have  been  a  time  when  one  argued  such  a  "government  mandate"  would  never  work.  I  almost  guarantee  someone  somewhere  made  that  argument.  There  may  be  bad  mandates,  I  believe  though  that  in  light  of  no  public  option  (which  I'd  prefer  actually)  mandating  a  certain  level  of  business  "cleanliness"  as  it  were  is  the  next  best  option.    As  for  subsidies.  Of  course  if  everyone  is  covered  that  would  be  inescapable,  at  least  until  everyone  is  in  the  system  then  maybe  even  the  poorest  will  be  able  to  afford  healthcare  because  of  a  larger  pool,  but  that  aside,  in  the  meantime  it  is  essential.  I  would  say  though,  that  subsidizing  say  a  breast  exam  which  finds  a  stage  1  tumor,  is  ultimately  less  expensive  than  not  finding  the  problem  until  the  woman  goes  to  the  emergency  room  during  stage  3.  We're  talking  a  $2,000  dollar  procedure  to  remove  a  tumor  against  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  of  treatment  we  would  be  subsidizing  anyway  when  she  goes  to  the  emergency  room.  And  then  there  is  the  whole  thing  about  the  woman's  life  and  all.    And  your  last  sentence,  I  actually  have  nothing  to  lose.  I'm  an  independant  contractor  so  pay  a  disproportionately  high  tax  rate  compared  to  income  already  and  still  don't  have  health  insurance.  But  if  I  did  receive  a  paycheck,  I  would  be  extatic  that  more  of  the  money  that  is  taken  out  will  go  toward  healthcare  instead  of  the  Insurance  money  machine.  I'm  pretty  sure  everyone  will  be  paying  less  in  the  long  term.  The  fact  is,  most  people  don't  get  that  sick,  so  if  you  have  a  bunch  of  people  paying  into  a  system,  it  is  pretty  simple  to  cover  the  people  who  do  get  sick,  or  oneself  if  they  are  the  unlucky  one.    That  is  how  insurance  is    supposed    to  work  anyway.  All  this  does  is  take  some  steps  to  make  sure  the  insurance  companies  can't  cheat  anymore.  I  almost  guarantee,  in  light  of  the  85%  law,  and  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the  millions  of  people  like  myself  who  are  relatively  healthy  but  still  simply  could  not  afford  it  are  now  going  to  be  paying  into  the  system,  everyone's  insurance  is  going  to  go  down  not  up.	1
Hell  no!  His  policies  are  crap  and  I  can't  wait  for  the  courts  to  overturn  his  health  care  bill  crap  ;)[SEP]There's  no  presidence  of  overthrowing  the  Healthcare  Bill.    And  I'm  still  trying  to  figure  out  why  you  are  against  something  that  will  gaurantee    even  your    coverage  if  say  you're  fired,  that  will  force  insurance  to  spend  at  least  85%  of  what  you  pay  into  it  for  healthcare  (instead  of  new  yachts  etc)  and  will  lower  our  national  debt  by  half  a  trillion  dollars  over  the  next  10  years.    It  is  truly  senseless.  I'm  not  sure  how  many  times  I  can  explain  this  to  you.[SEP]Why  they  are  calling  this  bill  health  care  reform  instead  of  health  insurance  is  reform  is  confusing  when  they  attack  health  insurance  companies?    The  most  logical  thing  for  anyone  is  to  drop  their  policy  or  if  uninsured,  remain  uninsured,  and  pay  $750/year  penalties  until  you  finally  get  sick,  then  anyone  can  buy  health  insurance  since  there  are  no  pre-existing  conditions.  It'll  be  like  avoiding  homeowners  insurance  to  save  money,  then  buying  some  once  your  house  is  on  fire  because  the  insurance  company  is  forced  to  sell  you  the  policy.    Sweet,  I  can  be  irresponsible  and  still  get  health  insurance.    THANK  YOU,  OBAMA!![SEP]1.  Paying  750  per  year  is  more  than  the  uninsured  are  putting  into  the  system  now,  so  it  is  better.    2.  The  fact  is,  people  without  insurance  have  a  45%  higher  chance  of  dying  earlier  because  they  don't  have  insurance.  Just  about  everyone    wants    insurance,  again,  it  is  not  an  issue  of  "personal  freedom"  and  if  you've  let  the  trillion  dollar  insurance  industry  trick  you  into  thinking  that  you've  been  duped.    3.  It's  absolutely  nothing  like  your  example  of  homeowners  insurance,  and  I  think  you  know  that.  As  you  keep  complaining  the  situation  is  more  like  making  homeowner  insurance  mandatory  for  everyone,  thus  lowering  the  cost  for  everyone,  thus  if  the  house  does  catch  on  fire  your  life  isn't  ruined  and  you  do  not  become  a  burden  on  society.    4.  I  find  the  assumption  that  only  the  "irresponsible"  don't  have  insurance  very  offensive.  The  vast  majority  of  the  uninsured  work  full  time  jobs  but  cannot  afford  it.    5.  Only  the  healthy  think  their  insurance  is  any  good.  There  is  a  very  high  possibility  that  before  this  bill  was  passed,  if  you  were  seriously  ill  your  insurance  would  have  found  a  reason  not  to  cover  or  to  only  cover  a  portion.  It  happens/  did  happen  all  of  the  time.    6.  The  number  one  cause  of  bankruptcy  is  illness.  The  majority  of  these  people  who  go  bankrupt  thought  they  had  good  insurance  until  they  got  sick.  This  is  a  huge  burden  on  our  economy,  and  now  it  won't  be.    7.  Again,  like  I've  explained  to  Joe  a  hundred  times,  the  only  way    your    insurance  is  going  to  change  if  you  are  already  insured  is  it  will  be  less  expensive,  you  will  get  rebates  if  85%  of  the  money  you  pay  hasn't  been  used  for  health  reasons,  and  your  insurance  won't  be  allowed  to  look  for  ways  to  not  cover  you  because  of  "pre-existing"  conditions.    All  this  fear  rhetoric  running  amok,  I  haven't  seen  a  single  piece  of  evidence  any  of  it  is  founded.    In  fact,  every  other  country  that  has  some  type  of  Universal  care  has  better  healthcare  than  the  US  and  they  pay  less  for  it.    There  is  no  real  life  example  that  says  otherwise.[SEP]I'm  going  to  address  these  concerns  starting  with  your  last  point:    5.  When  speaking  of  fear  rhetoric,  I'm  not  talking  about  your  argument  specifically,  but  all  of  the  death  panel  BS  and  socialist  take-over  nonsense  the  tea-baggers  spew,  whom  consequently  make  up  the  majority  of  the  opposition  and  all  of  the  death  threats,  bricks  through  windows,  etc.    The  1.05  trillion  dollar  price  tag  is  nominal,  but  not  that  nominal.  They  are  pretty  sure  it  will  be  between  1  trillion  and  1.5  trillion...    over  ten  years.    That  is  less  money  than  one  year  of  the  Iraq  war  and  instead  of  killing  people  we  are  saving  them.    4.  That  simply  is  not  true.  Rationing  should  only  exist  when  resources  are  limited,  however  the  difference  is,  the  insurance  industry  has  had  plenty  of  resources.  In  fact  even  in  this  economy  they  have  continued  turning  out  record  profits  while  at  the  same  time  covering  less  people.  Since  we  didn't  go  with  the  single  payer  system  for  some  mysterious  reason,  the  next  best  thing  is  to  legally  demand  the  private  companies  we  will  still  be  getting  our  insurance  from  are  legally  obligated  to  insure.    I  don't  doubt  they  will  still  find  ways  to  let  people  die  for  a  profit,  but  at  least  it  will  be  harder  for  them  to  do.    3.  Sounds  like  propaganda,  no  offense.  They    say    they  will  have  to  raise  rates,  but  I  don't  believe  them.  They  may    want    to  raise  rates,  but  they  won't  be  allowed  to  because  now  they  must  spend  85%  of  the  money  they  receive  directly  on  healthcare  or  they  will  lose  their  license  to  provide  insurance.  My  guess  is  they  will  actually  be  forced  to  lower  rates  since  only  something  like  10%  goes  toward  actual  healthcare  now.    2.

And  then  there  is  the  whole  thing  about  the  woman's  life  and  all.    And  your  last  sentence,  I  actually  have  nothing  to  lose.  I'm  an  independant  contractor  so  pay  a  disproportionately  high  tax  rate  compared  to  income  already  and  still  don't  have  health  insurance.

Blah,  I  moved  a  decimal,  you're  right.  I  feel  that  they  cost  just  as  much  is  as  solid  a  point  as  the  wars  costing  more,  either  way  it's  more  wasteful  imo.    Plus,  again,  we  won't  know  for  a  few  years,  but  every  country  that  has  done  something  similar  actually  pays  less  for  healthcare,  than  the  US    link    -  scroll  down  to  see  a  chart,  you'll  be  amazed.  I  think  there  is  something  lost  in  our  translation  following  the  money  trail,  much  of  that  cost  isn't  an  increase,  it's  a  shift  into  where  the  money  is  coming  from  and  how  it  is  tracked.  ie,  today  when  one  without  insurance  goes  to  the  emergency  room  it  is  not  a  cost  but  a  debt.  A  large  part  of  the  1-1.5  trillion    cost    represents  that  shift.  We're  paying  for  emergency  room  visits  now  anyway  in  other  words,  we  just  don't  count  it.  Either  way  we're  indebted  to  China,  but  that's  another  issue  entirely  and  I  don't  believe  this  will  effect  that  long  term  one  way  or  another.    3.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  I  think  a  Medicare  for  all  system  would  be  the  most  cost-effective  route.  As  for  incentive  to  stay  in  business,    link    -  they'll  still  be  the  second  richest  people  in  the  land  next  to  banks  even  with  new  regulations.    4.  Well,  the  problem  with  claiming  that  it  is  somehow  illegal  to  mandate  purchasing  healthcare  is  that  you  can  use  the  same  logic  that  you  use  for  "everyone  wants  a  clean  hospital."  In  that  "everyone  wants  to  go  to  the  doctor  when  they  are  sick."  Again,  the  problem  is  a  lack  of  imagination  on  the  part  of  the  healthy  I  think.  The  fact  is,  just  as  many  people,  when  sick,  want  insurance  as  want  a  clean  hospital  I  would  argue.  If  approached  as  a  mandate  for  private  consumption,  as  in  say  "it  is  the  law  of  the  land  you  buy  candy"  sure,  unconstitutional  as  hell.  However,  they  will  take  the  taxation  approach  I  believe.  Like  roads,  doctors  and  hospitals  are  a  a  privilege  afforded  all  citizens,  as  such,  like  roads,  paid  for  by  all  citizens.    5.  Yes,  it  should  be  health  insurance  reform.  The  left  wing  absolutely  sucks  and  naming  stuff.	0

He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?  That's  recklessly  irresponsible  unnecessary  spending.	0

I  do  not  think  Obama  should  be  president  in  '12  because  he's  making  all  these  promises  and  yet  he  has  not  fulfilled  any  of  them!  Lots  of  people  who  voted  for  him  our  now  just  realizing  that  maybe  his  isn't  so  good  after  all.  The  major  #1  reason  he  became  president  was  because  most  people  voted  for  him  because  he  was  going  to  be  the  first  black  president  (not  being  racist).  I  think  could  tons  of  black  people  who  could  run  for  president  and  do  a  way  better  job  then  Obama  is  doing.	1

I  do  not  think  Obama  should  be  president  in  '12  because  he's  making  all  these  promises  and  yet  he  has  not  fulfilled  any  of  them!

The  reason  he  actually  won  by  more  than  Bill  Clinton,  the  last  Democratic  President,  is  because  there  was  a  greater  overall  turnout.    A  greater  turnout  always  leads  to  a  democratic  victory,  because  the  majority  of  people  who  usually  would  not  vote  are  liberal  while  conservatives  almost  always  vote.

He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?  That's  recklessly  irresponsible  unnecessary  spending.[SEP]Please  reread  my  last  post.  I  edited  it.    S,  I  assume  that  when  April  15  comes,  you  just  love  paying  your  taxes.  You  jump  for  joy  and  sing  in  the  rain.  You  say,  Paying  Taxes  is  American.	1
No,  his  policies  are  crap.    He  ignores  that  majority  of  America  doesn't  want  Health  Care  but  he  still  pushes  it  through.  Ignorant  much?    Health  Care  is  another  way  of    Theft    for  the  government.    They  take  your  money  and  give  it  to  someone  else  and  themselves.    Being  forced  to  have  insurance  or  your  given  a  fine  on  your  income?  Wow,  totalitarianism  much?    Six  states  are  performing  a  law  suite  against  this.

That's  not  true.    As  for  Georgia,  I  would  need  a  lot  more  information  before  jumping  to  any  conclusions.  It  seems  like  there  should  be  a  way  for  the  UN  to  take  action  even  if  one  country  doesn't  want  to.  Also,  since  you  didn't  cite  a  source  I'm  going  to  presume  the  quote  is  out  of  context  and  misleading.  It  seems  ridiculous  for  you  to  be  picking  some  tiny,  obscure  statement  made  a  long  time  ago  and  using  it  to  make  Obama  seem  dumb.  If  that's  the  best  you've  got  it  just  shows  how  rarely  he  says  dumb  things.	0

In  short,  the  Bush  administration  on  average  increased  the  debt  more/  year.    Where  was  your  whining  then?  You  were  on  this  site  when  Bush  was  pres.    It's  an  odd  trend.  I  find  that  there  is  some  deep  dislike  for  Obama,  yet  when  each  reason  for  this  dislike  is  analyzed  in  comparison  to  other  Presidents  it  is  easily  seen  that  the  reason  mentioned,  in  your  case  spending,  is  not  the  reason  at  all.    I'm  curious,  why  is  it    really    that  you  dislike  him?  We've  established  it  could  not  possibly  be  spending  since  I  know  you  supported  Bush  on  several  occassions  without  a  word  about  spending  here  on  this  site.	0
He  has  done  absolutely  nothing  except  get  the  Nobel  peace  prize  for  something  he  didn't  accomplish.  He  got  the  health  care  bill  passed,  but  now  its  being  challenged.

And  you  should  be  especially  happy,  being  young  and  all,  you  will  have  insurance  when  you  graduate  even  if  you  don't  have  a  job.

Obama  according  to  these  two  lists,  has  done  more  in  less  than  two.  Weird  argument  on  your  part.	0
He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?  That's  recklessly  irresponsible  unnecessary  spending.[SEP]Ok,  I've  read  it.  I  don't  see  any  need  to  change  my  response  unless  I'm  missing  something  though.    And  I'll  soon  be  receiving  my  10k+  rebate  check.  I'll  let  you  guess  how  I  feel  about  that.	0
He  has  done  absolutely  nothing  except  get  the  Nobel  peace  prize  for  something  he  didn't  accomplish.  He  got  the  health  care  bill  passed,  but  now  its  being  challenged.  He  has  done  nothing  for  this  country  except  talk  and  tell  tales  and  lies  to  the  America  people.  I  will  be  18  for  the  next  presidential  election  and  as  hell  am  I  not  voting  for  him.[SEP]He's  already  done  more  than  some  presidents  in  there  entire  first  term.    Healthcare  is  something  Presidents  have  been  trying  to  do  since  Nixon.  If  he  did  nothing  else  he  would  have  already  done  more  than  most.  And  it's  only  being  challenged  by  crazy  people  with  no  understanding  of  the  laws  of  the  land.  It  will  never  be  repealed,  and  will  be  just  as  popular  as  social  security  and  Medicare  in  a  few  years,  once  all  the  crazy  fear  mongering  death  panel  government  take-over  bs  is  shown  to  be  the  rantings  of  lunatics...  which  it  is.

Obama  according  to  these  two  lists,  has  done  more  in  less  than  two.  Weird  argument  on  your  part.[SEP]Well,  most  of  your  list  is  not  definitive  accomplished  such  as      88.  Has  put  the  ball  in  play  for  comprehensive  immigration  reform    89.  Has  announced  his  intention  to  push  for  energy  reform    which  means  that  there  is  actually  no  real  reform.[SEP]I  can  say  the  same  thing  about  point  5  in  your  list.    Anyway,  it  doesn't  negate  the  general  point  that  Obama  is  a  busier  president.    And  that  the  original  argument  I  was  replying  to,  that  he  hasn't  done  anything,  is  demonstratably  untrue  and  the  result  of  a  complete  lack  of  knowledge  and  a  weird  pre-existing  dislike  impervious  to  actual  policy  issues.[SEP]I  can  agree  with  that  Obama  has  done  something  and  he  is  busier  than  Bush.	0
He's  shaping  up  to  be  possibly  a  top  10  president  if  he  continues  on  the  path  he's  followed  so  far...  the  odds  of  anyone  chalenging  him  in  2012  who  is  of  similar  calibre  are  pretty  close  to  non-existent.  Especially  from  the  GOP,  where  people  operating  at  that  level  frankly  simply  do  not  exist  right  now  and  couldn't  win  a  primary  against  the  "Tea  Baggers"  even  if  they  did.[SEP]TOP  10  Possible  President.  OHH,  Please.  It  has  only  been  a  year  and  3  months.[SEP]Yes,  exactly.  And  look  at  what  he's  already  accomplished.  So  as  I  said,    if  he  continues  on  this  path    he  is  certainly  shaping  up  to  be  in  the  top  10.[SEP]What  has  he  done?  Don't  mention  that  health  care  reform  because  we  both  know  that  it  is  health  insurance  reform  and  health  care  reform  is  fixing  the  actual  system  who  provide  the  actual  care.  Health  insurance  don't  provide  care,  they  finance  it.[SEP]Since  the  problem  with  the  health  care  system  in  the  US  has  never  been  quality  of  service  but  rather  ability  to    access    that  service,  I  think  I'll  just  ignore  you  since  you  have  no  idea  what  you're  talking  about  and  go  ahead  and  include  health  care  reform.    Hmmm,  what  else,  what  else.  Were  you  alive  when  he  took  office?  Did  you  have  access  to  any  media?  While  you  were  accessing  that  media  was  anyone  talking  about  the  economy  by  any  chance?  We  were  in  the  steepest  nose  dive  the  economy  has  experienced  since  the  Great  Depression.  Now  where  are  we  just  a  little  over  a  year  later?  Projected  6%  GDP  expansion  this  year.  Thank  you  very  much  stimulus  measures.  And  my  401k  has  most  of  it's  value  back.  Perhapos  you  don't  have  one,  but  I  rather  appreciate  that.    Remember  TARP?  That  thing  everyone  went  ballistic  over  when  it  was  passed  before  Obama  took  office  to  prevent  the  total  implosion  of  the  financial  sector?  It's  almost  all        paid  back        now.    We  can  do  stem  cell  research  properly  again.      Most  of  the  government  agencies  are  getting  restaffed  with  people  who  actually  have  some  freaking  clue  what  the  job  is  supposed  to  be,  which  is  refreshing.      Our  international  relations  have  practically  been  completely  reset  after  the  US  became  a  pariah  in  half  the  world  during  Bush's  term.  We're  slowly  but  steadily  getting  the  hell  out  of  Iraq  where  we  never  should  have  been  in  the  first  place.  Proper  focus  has  been  returned  to  AfPak  after  Bush  and  team  horrendously  neglected  it  for  years.  We've  been  rolling  up  senior  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  leaders  at  an  increased  pace  as  a  result,  we've  even  got  Pakistan  actually  actively  contributing  to  the  effort  for  a  wonder.  He  managed  NOT  to  go  grandstanding  and  screwing  up  the  situation  in  Iran  when  the  election  protests  erupted,  which  I  absolutely  guarantee  the  GOP  would  have  immediately  tried  to  spin  for  political  advantage  by  beating  their  chests  and  declaring  their  support  for  the  protesters...  a  more  certain  way  to  guarantee  they'd  be  instantly  crushed  I  can't  think  of.    Etc...    Refresh  my  memory...  what  did  the  last  guy  accomplish  in  his  first  year?  Besides  blow  the  surplus  he  was  handed  on  a  silver  platter  by  throwing  it  away  on  tax  cut  give-aways  primarily  to  the  rich  and  completely  ignore  every  intelligence  warning  on  al  Qaeda  until  9/11  happened  that  is?[SEP]I  wasn't  insulting  your  intelligence,  I  was  questioning  your  powers  of  observation.  You  may  be  brilliant  but  were  walking  around  with  your  eyes  shut  and  hands  clamped  over  your  ears  (for  brilliant  reasons,  I'm  sure)  and  thus  had  no  idea  what  had  happened.  It  was  as  good  an  explanation  as  anything  for  your  apparent  perception  that  Obama  hadn't  accomplished  anything.    And  I  didn't  assume  you  supported  anything.  You  asked  what  Obama  accomplished,  I  listed  accomplishments,  you  got  offended  that  I  responded  to  your  question.  That  is  the  sequence  of  events  here.    And  there  is  a  MASSIVE  difference  between  necessary  and  frivolous  government  spending  and  deficits.      Preventing  the  imminent  implosion  of  the  national  economy  and  a  plunge  into  a  Depression?  That's  an  environment  that        requires        spending  to  avert  total  disaster.    Passing  massive  tax  breaks  for  your  rich  buddies  and  bribing  seniors  with  prescription  drugs  right  before  an  election  without  paying  for  them?  That's  recklessly  irresponsible  unnecessary  spending.[SEP]No,  that  check  is  coming  almost  entirely  under  the  8k  new  home  buyers  credit  I'm  earning  for  buying  my  house  last  year...  which  was  passed  by...  hmmm,  who  was  that  guy  again?  Tall  fellow.  Dark  skin.  Currently  lives  in  a  large  white  house  out  east  somewhere...      Bush's  "tax  cuts"  do  next  to  squat  for  me.      Nice  try  though.	0
I  don't  see  why  not.  We  re-elected  squatter  George  W.  Bush  after  his  deplorable  performance  as  President  the  first  time  around.  All  the  data  indicate  the  jobs  and  the  economy  are  rebounding  as  Obama  slowly  cleans  up  after  the  Republican  mess.  Republicans  prefer  scare  tactics  to  data,  so  I  hear  many  people  saying  that  they're  "scared"  or  "worried,"  but  I  invite  you  to  examine  the  data  instead:  the  economy  is  on  the  rise,  jobs  are  on  the  rise,  so-called  "Obamacare"  has  been  helpful  to  many  and  finally  brought  us  to    even    with  much  of  the  rest  of  the  world  which  has  been  doing  something  similar  for  years,  and  we  are  still  able  to  defend  ourselves  reasonably  well  despite  Obama's  less  military  stance  (we  DID  get  Osama  during  his  term,  didn't  we?)(no,  he  didn't  just  "happen"  to  be  president,  he  helped    make    it  "happen").  Unless  the  Republicans  can  come  up  with  someone  smarter,  better,  and  more  Presidential,  I  will  be  re-electing  him  gratefully.	0

The  court  challenges  seek  to  determine  if  SB1070:    &gt;  violates  the  federal  Supremacy  Clause  (Article  6  Clause  2)  by  attempting  to  bypass  federal  immigration  law;    &gt;  violates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  and  Equal  Protection  Clause  rights  of  racial  and  national  origin  minorities  by  subjecting  them  to  stops,  detentions,  and  arrests  based  on  their  race  or  origin;    &gt;  violates  the  First  Amendment  rights  of  freedom  of  speech  by  exposing  speakers  to  scrutiny  based  on  their  language  or  accent;    &gt;  violates  the  Fourth  Amendment's  prohibition  of  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures  because  it  allows  for  warrantless  searches  in  absence  of  probable  cause;    &gt;  violates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment's  Due  Process  Clause  by  being  impermissibly  vague;    &gt;  infringes  on  constitutional  provisions  that  protect  the  right  to  travel  without  being  stopped,  questioned,  or  detained.    It  is  justified  to  establish  which  parts  of  the  law  are  enforceable  and  which  arenât.

There  are  only  3  states  where  it  is  legal  for  non-residents  to  obtain  driver's  licenses  -  Washington,  New  Mexico  and  Utah.  They  made  these  decisions  based  on  the  idea  that  licensed  drivers  are  less  likely  to  be  in  accidents    ref  ,  the  ability  to  buy  insurance,  and,  frankly,  because  it  raises  revenue  in  license,  registration  and  other  fees.

No,  for  many  reasons.  First,  and  most  simply,  Obama  has  fairly  low  ratings.  Lower  than  what  is  usually  necessary  to  get  re-elected.  Also,  just  recently,  the  American  public  voted  in  a  lot  more  republicans  to  the  house  if  that  tells  you  anything  about  the  majority  opinion  of  democrats  (which  Obama  represents).  People  are  also  disapproving  (for  the  most  part)  of  the  legislation  he  has  introduced,  particularly  the  health  care  act.  Even  many  liberals  are  angry  with  him  because  of  how  many  compromises  he  has  made  with  the  now  republican  house  so  he  may  not  even  make  the  nomination.	1
If  he  is  than  were  all  doomed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  After  4  more  years  of  this  the  country  would  be  in  shambles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Unless  the  GOP  can  come  up  with  a  candidate  with  a  real  chance  of  beating  Obama,  he  will  no  doubt  be  re-elected.	0

This  links  to    an  article    about  federal  funding  going  to  Maryland  and  Pennsylvania's  high  risk  insurance  pools.      This  requires  knowledge  of  2  things  -      First,  an  understanding  of  a  property  of  money  -  fungibility.    To  illuminate:  if  a  woman  gets  federal  money,  e.g.  a  student  loan,  a  pell  grant,  etc.  and  puts  the  money  in  a  bank  account  and  later  gets  an  abortion  using  funds  in  that  bank  account,  it  does  not  mean  that  federal  money  subsidized  the  abortion.    Second,  what  was  actually  in  the  bill:      "specifically  prohibits  the  use  of  federal  dollars  to  fund  abortions,  except  in  the  case  of  rape,  incest  or  when  the  mother's  life  in  peril.  Rather,  insurance  companies  would  be  required  to  pay  for  abortion  services  from  a  segregated  pool  of  money  funded  through  patient  premiums.  Essentially,  people  who  select  plans  that  cover  abortions  would  have  to  pay  at  least  $1  a  month  of  their  premiums  into  a  separate  account.  Any  abortion  services  provided  by  the  insurer  would  have  to  be  drawn  from  that  segregated  account.    On  top  of  that,  the  national  health  care  law  gives  states  an  opt-out  of  abortion  coverage  altogether.  States  could  pass  laws  to  prohibit  abortion  coverage  in  health  plans  offered  on  the  state  exchange  if  they  chose."        http://www.politifact.com/florida/  statements/2011/mar/17/matt-gaetz/  taxpayer-funded-abortions-federal-healt  h-care-bill/	0

Obama  Campaign  Video    I  Barely  Know  Rezko    Sun  Times    My  Church  Is  Like  Any  Other  Christian  Church    ABC  News[SEP]No  signing  statements  to  nullify  or  undermine  congressional  instructions  as  enacted  into  law        Here  is  Obama's  full  memo:      Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies          SUBJECT:  Presidential  Signing  Statements          For  nearly  two  centuries,  Presidents  have  issued  statements  addressing  constitutional  or  other  legal  questions  upon  signing  bills  into  law  (signing  statements).  Particularly  since  omnibus  bills  have  become  prevalent,  signing  statements  have  often  been  used  to  ensure  that  concerns  about  the  constitutionality  of  discrete  statutory  provisions  do  not  require  a  veto  of  the  entire  bill.          In  recent  years,  there  has  been  considerable  public  discussion  and  criticism  of  the  use  of  signing  statements  to  raise  constitutional  objections  to  statutory  provisions.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  practice  of  issuing  such  statements  can  be  abused.  Constitutional  signing  statements  should  not  be  used  to  suggest  that  the  President  will  disregard  statutory  requirements  on  the  basis  of  policy  disagreements.  At  the  same  time,  such  signing  statements  serve  a  legitimate  function  in  our  system,  at  least  when  based  on  well-founded  constitutional  objections.  In  appropriately  limited  circumstances,  they  represent  an  exercise  of  the  President's  constitutional  obligation  to  take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully  executed,  and  they  promote  a  healthy  dialogue  between  the  executive  branch  and  the  Congress.          With  these  considerations  in  mind  and  based  upon  advice  of  the  Department  of  Justice,  I  will  issue  signing  statements  to  address  constitutional  concerns  only  when  it  is  appropriate  to  do  so  as  a  means  of  discharging  my  constitutional  responsibilities.  In  issuing  signing  statements,  I  shall  adhere  to  the  following  principles:      1.The  executive  branch  will  take  appropriate  and  timely  steps,  whenever  practicable,  to  inform  the  Congress  of  its  constitutional  concerns  about  pending  legislation.  Such  communication  should  facilitate  the  efforts  of  the  executive  branch  and  the  Congress  to  work  together  to  address  these  concerns  during  the  legislative  process,  thus  minimizing  the  number  of  occasions  on  which  I  am  presented  with  an  enrolled  bill  that  may  require  a  signing  statement.      2.Because  legislation  enacted  by  the  Congress  comes  with  a  presumption  of  constitutionality,  I  will  strive  to  avoid  the  conclusion  that  any  part  of  an  enrolled  bill  is  unconstitutional.  In  exercising  my  responsibility  to  determine  whether  a  provision  of  an  enrolled  bill  is  unconstitutional,  I  will  act  with  caution  and  restraint,  based  only  on  interpretations  of  the  Constitution  that  are  well-founded.      3.To  promote  transparency  and  accountability,  I  will  ensure  that  signing  statements  identify  my  constitutional  concerns  about  a  statutory  provision  with  sufficient  specificity  to  make  clear  the  nature  and  basis  of  the  constitutional  objection.      4.I  will  announce  in  signing  statements  that  I  will  construe  a  statutory  provision  in  a  manner  that  avoids  a  constitutional  problem  only  if  that  construction  is  a  legitimate  one.    To  ensure  that  all  signing  statements  previously  issued  are  followed  only  when  consistent  with  these  principles,  executive  branch  departments  and  agencies  are  directed  to  seek  the  advice  of  the  Attorney  General  before  relying  on  signing  statements  issued  prior  to  the  date  of  this  memorandum  as  the  basis  for  disregarding,  or  otherwise  refusing  to  comply  with,  any  provision  of  a  statute.    This  memorandum  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right  or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by  any  party  against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities,  its  officers,  employees,  or  agents,  or  any  other  person.    This  memorandum  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register.      Here  is  a  list  of  Obama's  signing  statements:      http://www.coherentbabble.com/  listBHOall.htm        which  one(s)  do  not  comport  with  the  above?	0

Obama  2012![SEP]Half  of  the  "facts"  I  see  here  are  either  untrue  or  not  even  directly  associated  with  anything  Obama  has  done.  The  economy  hasn't  recovered.  The  sharp  decrease  in  unemployment  was  due  to  the  number  of  people  who  stopped  getting  unemployment  benefits  after  looking  for  employment  for  years.  Note:  you  are  only  counted  as  unemployed  if  you  are  still  actively  looking  for  a  job.  How  did  he  single-handedly  save  the  U.S.  auto  industry?  The  deaths  of  the  22  Al  Queda  Heads  were  the  cause  of  the  hard-working  men  and  women  in  the  military.  Not  sure  how  he's  even  indirectly  responsible  for  that.  How  has  he  improved  relations  with  other  countries?  Afghanistan  still  hates  us  (probably  because  we're  invading  them,  but  no  one  wants  to  talk  about  that  war),  Iraq  hates  us  more  than  ever  since  we  left,  as  soon  as  we  got  out  of  Iraq,  Iran  decides  to  start  talking  about  a  possible  conflict  with  the  U.S,  and  Israel  is  starting  to  hate  us  as  a  direct  result  from  Obama's  foreign  policy  on  Israel.  He  isn't  a  small  spender.  Fact:  he  has  spent  more  money  in  3  years  than  any  other  president  has  in  8  (that  counts  inflation).  And  just  to  top  it  off,  he's  spent  more  money  on  vacations  than  any  other  president.  I  do  believe  his  last  Hawaiin  vacation  costs  $4  million,  99.7%  of  it  being  taxpayer  dollars.  Do  your  research  man.  He's  terrible  at  his  job	1

As  an  outsider  with  no  allegiance  to  the  democrats  or  the  republicans,  it  would  be  fair  to  say  that  I  can  look  at  this  somewhat  objectively.    To  all  that  consider  Obama  a  failure,  just  look  at  some  stats.  Low  expenditure,  continued  job  growth,  Iraq  conflict  over.  If  that's  failing,  then  succeeding  would  be  miraculous.    Besides,  most  of  his  rivals  seem  unlikely  to  stand  a  chance.  Whilst  my  knowledge  of  US  politics  is  limited,  I  know  that  you  guys  have  the  following  choices:  a  weak  moderate,  an  extreme  Christian  theocratic,  a  radical  that  doesn't  belong  on  either  party,  and  the  other  guy.

President  Obama  decided  that  if  we  got  a  lead  on  Bin  Laden's  location,  we  weren't  going  to  share  it  with  Pakistani  officials,  and  what  do  you  know  we  finally  got  him.  Coincidence?	0

President  Obama  doesn't  have  the  first  clue  to  economics  nor  do  his  economist  advisers.[SEP]The  economy  was  already  taking  a  nosedive  when  he  stepped  into  office,  and  when  he  tried  to  pass  his  jobs  bill  to  fix  it,  republicans  vote  it  down  and  then  proceeded  to  blame  him  for  high  unemployment.  Strange  how  that  works.    The  Auto-industry  was  on  the  verge  of  collapse,  when  he  came  into  office  and  now  it's  going  strong.  GM  specifically  was  17  months  away  from  bankruptcy  and  now  it's  stocks  are  soaring  and  it  has  already  paid  back  $11.8  billion  to  tax  payers,  5  years  ahead  of  schedule.  Of  the  bank  bailouts  66%  of  it  has  been  paid  back  already.  These  averted  bankruptcy  and  saved  millions  of  jobs.  Had  we  have  let  these  industries  go  bankrupt,  unemployment  would  have  rocketed  to  levels  not  seen  since  the  last  great  depression.  Now  add  to  that  the  fact  that  under  His  presidency  Osama  was  killed,  Gadaffi  was  killed,  Egyptian  President  Mubarak  was  overthrown,  and  the  Iraq  war  was  ended.  Considering  all  the  problems  we  face  I'd  say  he's  doing  pretty  well.

He's  a  great  president:  he  cares  about  his  citizens,  allows  compromises  with  people  outside  his  own  party,  is  an  excellent  foreign  policy  president,  cares  about  education  and  student  loans,  ended  a  war,  and  managed  to  negotiate  with  a  hostile  ruler  to  step  down  and  keep  an  oppressed  from  total  rebellion  which  would  have  killed  thousands  if  not  millions  of  people...  He  may  not  be  perfect  but  I'd  definitely  vote  for  him  over  Romney.	0
Obama  is  doing  the  best  he  can  with  what  he  was  given  and  how  the  political  environment  changed  over  the  course  of  his  presidency.  Bush  is  the  equivalent  of  this  in  some  measure,  however  insofar  as  his  response  to  911  and  the  crediting  the  wars,  he  made  the  situation  worse,  not  that  we  should  not  have  responded  to  the  attacks  but  it  was  how  we  did  it  -  shaving  a  bit  off  the  constitution  and  committing  to  two  ~10  year  wars  on  borrowed  money.      -Blaming  Obama  for  how  things  are  now  is  kind  of  like  yelling  at  the  person  trying  desperately  to  catch  all  of  the  shit  flying  off  the  fan  after  it  hit  and  blaming  him  for  missing  a  few  of  the  pieces.-      Bush  had  to  deal  with  the  terrorist  threat  which  was  thrust  upon  him  but  i  think  that  how  he  handled  that  was  less  optimal  than  how  Obama  has  handled  things  since  he  took  over.  I  am  going  to  vote  for  him  again  in  the  coming  election  because  he  is  our  best  chance  and  has  done  a  good  job  thus  far  -  just  look  at  the  job  growth  -  the  sluggishness  of  the  markets  and  this  effect  on  job  growth  and  economic  prosperity  has  nothing  to  do  with  him  and  his  efficacy  as  a  president  -  the  conditions  of  our  economic  environment  both  domestically  and  internationally  are  the  biggest  influence  in  our  slow  recovery      Insofar  as  the  economy  goes,  Bush  didnt  cause  the  collapse,  but  he  did  increase  the  national  debt  for  these  two  not  fully  thought  out  wars  (which  we  havent  really  won  even  though  we  have  made  some  significant  positive  changes  in  the  region).      Obama's  policies  reflect  what  more  people  want  and  is  the  only  logical  choice  for  the  next  presidentail  term.  (i  am  an  independent  with  liberal  inclinations)	0

I'm  not  sure  how  this  addresses  anything  I  just  said.  In  fact  I'm  fairly  certain  it  doesn't;  The  cause  of  the  'economic  demise'  was  never  in  question,  but  you  did  just  completely  side-step  my  contention.  The  president  drafted  up  a  bill,  to  improve  the  employment  rate  and  to  provide  jobs,  congressional  Republicans  voted  that  bill  down,  and  yet  they  continue  to  use  in  their  rhetoric  the  fact  unemployment  is  still  high  as  reasons  we  should  disapprove  of  the  President.    Point  being  you  can't  blame  someone  for  high  unemployment  when  you  personally  prevented  them  from  solving  the  problem,  without  being  the  world's  biggest  hypocrite.      To  suggest  that  the  auto  industry  was  on  the  verge  of  collapse  is  a  hypothetical      No  it's  not,  it  was  a  mathematical  equation.  GM  had  been  in  continuous  decline  for  over  a  decade.  It  was  17  months  from  bankruptcy  and  a  46%  chance  of  defaulting  within  the  next  5  years.  GM  already  filed  for  chapter  11,  and  was  selling  off  most  of  it's  assets.  To  deny  this  is  the  utmost  absurdity.    The  Math  is  here:      http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm      Bankruptcy  here:      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization        bankruptcy  is  vital  to  capitalism  because  it  disposes  of  waste.      Yeah,  and  that  waste  was  millions  of  employees,  without  whom  would  have  meant  unprecedented  levels  of  unemployment  not  seen  since  the  great  depression,  which  would  have  taken  almost  a  decade  or  more  to  recover  from.      GM  didn't  pay  off  the  loan.  They  merely  shifted  money  from  the  escrow  account  to  the  loan.              In  an  interview  with  PolitiFact,  Lawrence  J.  White,  economist  at  New  York  University's  Stern  School  of  Business,  warned  not  to  make  too  much  of  the  source  of  the  funding.    "To  me,  money  is  fungible,"  he  said.  ''At  the  end  of  the  day,  it  shows  that  GM  found  itself  with  enough  of  a  surplus  to  pay  back  this  piece  of  government  support.  The  escrow  was  not  a  new  government  loan  to  pay  back  the  old  loan.    "It's  a  genuine  paying  back,"  White  said.  "It  does  reduce  the  federal  government's  involvement."  Still,  he  said,  "it  sure  doesn't  wipe  clean  the  slate"  with  the  U.S.  government.

Which  is  still  a  good  sign.      All  of  which  were  created  by  bad  government  policy  before.      Yeah,  like  the  irresponsible  deregulation  of  the  housing  and  banking  markets.  When  you  repeal  laws  that  prevent  downright  criminal  business  practices,  this  can  have  a  detrimental  effect.  I  don't  share  your  faith,  the  private  sector  can  fail,  and  history  is  our  proof  of  this.  If  you  allow  multi-million  dollar  businesses  to  pilfer  people  of  their  savings  and  their  homes,  that  is  exactly  what  they  will  do  and  that  is  exactly  what  happened  in  2008.	0
It's  funny  how  everyone  blames  the  Republicans  for  this  recession.  "Blame  the  Republicans.  It's  really  their  fault."  That  just  shows  how  uneducated  everyone  in  his  fan-club  is.  The  simple  fact  is  that  every  single  one  of  the  last  presidents  saw  the  recession  coming,  but  no  one  really  knew  how  to  stop  it.  Now  that  it's  here,  Obama  doesn't  know  how  to  fix  it.  The  fact  is  that  the  fault  crosses  party  lines.  However,  Obama  had  Congress  in  the  palm  of  his  hand  for  two  years  and  they  did  everything  he  wanted.  They  authorized  bailout  after  bailout,  and  let  him  spend  as  much  as  he  pleased.  Now  common  sense  can  tell  you  that  when  you  don't  have  any  money,  you  need  to  stop  spending  as  much.  The  Republicans  won't  agree  with  him  because  he  spends  way  too  much  and  won't  negotiate.  Negotiating  actually  involves  BOTH  parties  giving  up  something  they  want  so  that  both  parties  can  get  something  they  do  want.	1
"Yes  we  can!"  roared  the  crowd.  It  was  an  emotional  night  for  everyone.  The  2008  presidential  election  was  over.  John  McCain  had  lost  to  the  first  major  party  endorsed  African-American  presidential  candidate  in  United  States  history.  We  finally  closed  troubling  chapters  in  our  history  such  as  Mississippi  burning  and  the  civil  rights  marches  of  Selma.    Republicans,  including  the  bewildered  Religious  Right,  sat  stunned  in  their  seats  wondering  what  would  happen  to  their  country.  It  was  not  because  the  Democratic  Party  was  any  different  from  the  Bush  Administration  but  because  the  GOP  had  pathetically  lost  its  neo-conservative  bully  pulpit  in  the  White  House.    Democrats  cheered  with  glee  at  the  opportunity  to  take  back  the  power  that  was  theirs  during  the  Clinton  Glory  Days.  They  salivated  at  the  prospect  of  re-introducing  neo-liberal  interventionism  on  foreign  soil  and  overseas  markets  They  longed  to  once  again  crank  the  Dollar  presses  to  inflate  the  money  supply  in  the  name  of  the  "poor"  this  time  instead  of  "business".  They  would  gladly  finish  the  work  of  the  Fall  of  the  American  Empire  started  under  the  Bush  Regime.    And  now,  the  smoke  and  mirrors  game  goes  on.  The  crooked  politicians  of  2009  are  no  different  than  the  corrupt  politicians  of  the  Gilded  Age  or  the  Roaring  Twenties.  Crony  capitalists  like  oil  barons  and  railway  tycoons  then  lined  the  pockets  of  our  nation's  representatives  to  further  the  goals  of  Big  Business  and  destroy  the  wealth  of  American  workers.  Sound  familiar?    President  Obama  had  a  unique  opportunity  in  history  --  and  he  blew  it.  He  brought  us  "change"  indeed.  He  slammed  the  Bush  Doctrine  in  all  its  ugly  forms  of  secrecy  and  judicial  obstruction  into  executive  hyper-drive.  The  rhetoric  of  compassionate  conservative  now  became  the  drivel  of  compassionate  liberalism.    If  there  is  one  thing  Americans  say  about  Obama  it  is  this:  he  cares.    He  cares  for  the  mechanic  in  Detroit  who  lost  his  job.  He  cares  for  the  middle-aged  couple  living  in  the  Hooverville  tent  outside  Sacramento.  He  cares  for  the  middle  class  mother  and  her  three  kids  in  Toledo  spending  their  nights  in  a  homeless  shelter  with  the  addicted  and  the  ignored.    But  does  Obama  really  care?    In  fact,  his  compassionate  liberalism  runs  so  deep  that  it  pulls  a  move  from  the  old  Ronald  Reagan  playbook  we  knew  as  trickle-down  economics.  These  days  the  compassionate  White  House  grants  bail-out  money  to  financial  monsters  like  AIG  and  Bank  of  America.  There  could  be  no  better  help  for  the  American  veteran  shivering  under  a  bridge  tonight  because  there  just  aren't  any  more  jobs.  (Unless  of  course,  you  can  beat  out  the  200  other  people  applying  for  that  one  lonely  job  opening.)  The  idea  is  that  bail-out  money  will  sooner  or  later  trickle-down  to  the  great  unwashed  masses  of  Americans  wondering  what  in  Sam  Hill  happened  to  the  real  estate  market  and  their  retirement  accounts.      It  may  only  be  a  drop  of  financial  bail-out  --  but  hey  it  trickled  down.  Next  up,  bread  lines!    The  truth  is  that  the  White  House  allowed  corporate  giant  CEOs  to  loot  and  pilfer  the  public  treasury.  This  Administration  is  following  the  same  tortured  logic  of  the  previous  one  which  assured  us  that  falsely  accused  cab  drivers  from  Baghdad  were  receiving  comfortable  attention  at  Guantanamo  Bay.    The  left-right  political  paradigm  in  this  country  is  a  sham.  (Sorry  to  disappoint  my  fellow  Evangelical  Christians.)  Both  parties  have  proven  to  be  Big  Business,  Big  Government  warmongers.  For  those  who  actually  wished  McCain  had  been  elected  just  think  about  this:  the  GOP  would  have  put  up  no  opposition  to  the  new  President's  Stimulus  Package  and  would  have  rammed  through  trillions  more  in  "help"  for  America.    So  there  you  have  it.  President  Obama  is  as  bad  as  the  worst  conservative  and  as  bad  as  the  worst  liberal  --  and  all  with  a  smile.    How  is  the  left-right  scenario  a  sham?  Consider  the  following.    The  gay  rights  issue  is  a  political  distraction.  Stem  cell  research?  Just  more  Big  Research  pork-barrel  spending.  Abortion?  It's  the  political  Gordian  Knot  that  requires  even  the  most  astute  of  political  science  majors  to  bust  a  gut  if  they  dare  try  to  untie  it.  The  so-called  immigration  invasion?  A  typical  act  of  sensational  yellow  journalism  that  says,  "Look  over  there,  Bubba!  It  ain't  your  own  government  stealin'  your  hard-earned  dollars,  it's  them  Mexicans  lookin'  for  revenge  and  dishwasher  jobs  since  the  Alamo!"  Sorry,  Pat  Buchanan,  the  "Death  of  the  West"  comes  from  the  corruption  in  our  government,  not  the  immigrants  heading  back  home  in  record  numbers.    What  are  the  real  issues  of  post-election  America?  For  starters,  the  destruction  of  individual  wealth  in  this  country,  save  for  the  high  upper  class.  We  are  on  the  verge  of  an  economic  meltdown  that  will  dwarf  the  Great  Depression  and  will  take  decades  to  recover.  There  is  no  need  for  a  conspiracy  theory  here  --  only  the  urgency  of  understanding  the  mess  that  we  allowed  to  happen  and  how  we  can  financially  protect  ourselves.    We  must  not  waste  time.  We  must  move  our  already-compromised  and  over-valued  U.S.  Dollars  into  assets  of  real  value.  This  does  not  include  real  estate  unless  you're  buying  ten  cents  or  less  on  the  high-priced  dollar.  Forget  your  401(k),  pensions  and  your  annuities.  Unless  you  can  take  your  money  out,  they  are  toast.  The  stock  market  is  one  toxic  graveyard,  particularly  finance  shares.  Dump  them.  Invest  in  precious  metals,  food  supply,  cigarettes,  alcohol  and  medicine  for  trade  and  help  for  your  neighbors  when  the  Dollar  collapses.    Consider  buying  silver,  palladium  and  gold  from  reputable  sellers  like  apmex.com.  I  personally  recommend  silverbullion.com  because  I  support  the  goals  of  the  owner  Jason  Hommel  to  bring  silver  back  as  the  most  effective  medium  of  exchange.  Remember,  that  despite  the  U.S.  Treasury's  naked  assertions,  the  U.S.  Constitution  expressly  reserves  the  right  of  individual  States  to  mint  legal  tender  coins  so  long  as  they're  gold  or  silver.    When  the  dollar  collapses,  I  do  not  think  that  New  York  City  will  burn  or  that  the  United  States  will  come  to  an  immediate  end.  But  if  it  did,  the  blame  must  rest  entirely  on  Barack  Obama  and  his  Congressional  Criminal  Syndicate.    Some  might  here  criticize  me  as  being  unfair.  After  all,  George  W.  Bush  The  Evangelical  nearly  bankrupted  this  country  with  his  illegal  wars,  his  blatant  lies  to  stir  Americans  to  bloodshed,  his  deliberate  obstruction  to  the  9/11  Commission,  his  last-minute  corporate  bailout  to  the  tune  of  hundreds  of  billions,  his  economic  tinkering  with  interest  rates,  his  unconscionable  acts  of  torturing  innocent  men  and  children,  his  doubling  of  the  national  debt,  et  cetera,  et  cetera.      But  let  me  be  clear  about  this.  George  W.  Bush  is  a  public  menace.  He  and  his  cadre  must  be  tried  and  convicted  of  their  crimes.  But  that  will  never  happen  under  an  Obama  Presidency,  in  spite  of  the  President's  left-leaning  brand  of  crony  capitalism.  The  Truth  Commission  currently  at  play  in  the  Congress  is  merely  a  circus  show  to  fool  Americans  into  thinking  that  we  actually  take  seriously  the  crimes  of  torture,  invasion,  occupation,  mayhem,  pillaging,  looting,  rape,  pollution,  perjury,  bribery  and  killing  of  civilians  with  illegal  weapons  of  war.    Every  moment  that  the  Obama  Administration  rolls  on  without  prosecuting  the  crimes  of  the  former  Administration,  it  exists  as  a  de  facto  confirmation  that  our  new  President  has  sold  out  to  the  rich  and  that  he  lied  to  his  Democratic  base  and  the  American  voter.  The  White  House  today  has  continued  in  the  same  deadly  bait-and-switch  tactics  of  the  former  Village  Idiot-In-Chief.  Additionally,  Obama  has  moved  to  control  more  media  and  aggressively  solidify  relationships  with  members  of  the  "War  and  Bankers  Party"  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle.    For  a  President  to  vociferously  take  on  Rush  Limbaugh  the  GOP's  talk  radio  attack  dog  is  an  alarming  signal.  Besides  the  fact  that  the  Democrats  want  to  point  out  the  weakness  of  the  GOP's  leadership  vacuum,  Obama  is  inserting  himself  into  the  realm  of  media  and  entertainment  instead  of  focusing  on  how  his  office  can  uphold  and  defend  the  U.S.  Constitution  in  light  of  the  economic  crisis.  Are  we  really  so  surprised  to  see  the  leftist  authoritarian  Hugo  Chavez,  who  is  a  regular  media  personality,  cheer  Obama  in  his  nationalization  and  socialization  of  the  banking  and  insurance  industries?    Evangelical  Christian  radio  stations  are  scared  stiff  about  the  Democratic-led  Congress  reviving  restrictions  on  Americans  to  share  their  religious  opinions  over  the  people's  airwaves.  And  they  should  be  concerned.  (I  particularly  enjoy  my  local  station.)  After  all,  the  same  kind  of  government  that  monitors,  censors,  filters  and  controls  any  form  of  media  is  the  same  type  of  authoritarianism  that  steals,  plunders  and  coerces  its  own  people.  One  look  at  China's  control  of  the  internet  and  Google's  sickening  overture  to  that  regime  is  enough  to  make  any  civil  libertarian's  skin  crawl.  Reports  that  Australia  is  considering  Chinese-style  filtering  over  what  their  people  can  access  on  the  internet  makes  me  want  to  boycott  eucalyptus  leaves.    So  why  is  President  Obama  responsible  for  our  economic  debacle?    Because  it's  the  first  rule  of  leadership.  Everything  is  your  fault.  If  he  didn't  like  the  prospect  of  being  stuck  with  the  mess  of  his  predecessor  he  should  have  remained  in  the  Senate  or  considered  an  honest  living  like  working  for  AIG  or  Lehmann  Brothers.  Obama  has  not  only  repeated  the  same  unconstitutional  trespasses  of  Bush  II,  but  he  actually  increased  the  amount  of  corporate  welfare  to  the  Bank  Barons.  Obama  turned  a  blind  eye  to  the  Federal  Reserve's  arbitrary  usury  practice  through  the  printing  of  increasingly  worthless  U.S.  Dollars.    Are  we  really  going  to  see  a  Dow  Jones  4000?  The  answer  is  regrettably  yes  --  and  then  some.  There  are  economic  forces  at  play  that  will  no  longer  be  ignored  or  manipulated.  Human  behavior  will  always  gravitate  towards  self-preservation  and  the  protection  of  our  future  generations  through  wealth-building,  capital,  production  and  labor.  All  the  paper  fiat  money  and  government  spending  in  the  world  can  never  stop  that  or  help  this  economic  disaster  recover  without  drastic  corrections  to  our  own  cursed  speculative  market.  The  times  of  fast  and  easy  money  are  over.    President  Obama  has  not  even  finished  his  first  year  in  office  and  I  must  already  call  him  out  as  one  of  the  worst  Executives  ever  in  the  history  of  our  Republic.  Bush  II  is  close  behind.  Every  GOP  and  Democratic  elected  leader  that  voted  for  any  of  these  crooked  bail-outs  deserves  a  one-way  ticket  to  an  electoral  defeat.  Should  state  law  allow  it,  a  public  tar-and-feathering  might  be  in  order.    When  our  country  faced  economic  dangers,  depressionary  woes  and  international  volatility  let  it  be  said  that  President  Obama  failed  to  protect  us  from  the  corruption  of  Congress,  the  indifference  of  the  Judiciary  and  the  foolishness  of  the  People.  Let  it  be  said  that  he  abandoned  his  post  to  uphold  the  Constitution.  Let  it  be  said  that  he  whored  his  policies  and  his  office  for  the  rich  and  powerful,  both  foreign  and  domestic.  Let  it  be  said  that  we  voted  for  change  and  all  we  got  was  the  Raw  Deal  of  the  Obama  Failure  obama  is  a  failure	1
"Yes  we  can!"  roared  the  crowd.  It  was  an  emotional  night  for  everyone.  The  2008  presidential  election  was  over.  John  McCain  had  lost  to  the  first  major  party  endorsed  African-American  presidential  candidate  in  United  States  history.  We  finally  closed  troubling  chapters  in  our  history  such  as  Mississippi  burning  and  the  civil  rights  marches  of  Selma.    Republicans,  including  the  bewildered  Religious  Right,  sat  stunned  in  their  seats  wondering  what  would  happen  to  their  country.  It  was  not  because  the  Democratic  Party  was  any  different  from  the  Bush  Administration  but  because  the  GOP  had  pathetically  lost  its  neo-conservative  bully  pulpit  in  the  White  House.    Democrats  cheered  with  glee  at  the  opportunity  to  take  back  the  power  that  was  theirs  during  the  Clinton  Glory  Days.  They  salivated  at  the  prospect  of  re-introducing  neo-liberal  interventionism  on  foreign  soil  and  overseas  markets  They  longed  to  once  again  crank  the  Dollar  presses  to  inflate  the  money  supply  in  the  name  of  the  "poor"  this  time  instead  of  "business".  They  would  gladly  finish  the  work  of  the  Fall  of  the  American  Empire  started  under  the  Bush  Regime.    And  now,  the  smoke  and  mirrors  game  goes  on.  The  crooked  politicians  of  2009  are  no  different  than  the  corrupt  politicians  of  the  Gilded  Age  or  the  Roaring  Twenties.  Crony  capitalists  like  oil  barons  and  railway  tycoons  then  lined  the  pockets  of  our  nation's  representatives  to  further  the  goals  of  Big  Business  and  destroy  the  wealth  of  American  workers.  Sound  familiar?    President  Obama  had  a  unique  opportunity  in  history  --  and  he  blew  it.  He  brought  us  "change"  indeed.  He  slammed  the  Bush  Doctrine  in  all  its  ugly  forms  of  secrecy  and  judicial  obstruction  into  executive  hyper-drive.  The  rhetoric  of  compassionate  conservative  now  became  the  drivel  of  compassionate  liberalism.    If  there  is  one  thing  Americans  say  about  Obama  it  is  this:  he  cares.    He  cares  for  the  mechanic  in  Detroit  who  lost  his  job.  He  cares  for  the  middle-aged  couple  living  in  the  Hooverville  tent  outside  Sacramento.  He  cares  for  the  middle  class  mother  and  her  three  kids  in  Toledo  spending  their  nights  in  a  homeless  shelter  with  the  addicted  and  the  ignored.    But  does  Obama  really  care?    In  fact,  his  compassionate  liberalism  runs  so  deep  that  it  pulls  a  move  from  the  old  Ronald  Reagan  playbook  we  knew  as  trickle-down  economics.  These  days  the  compassionate  White  House  grants  bail-out  money  to  financial  monsters  like  AIG  and  Bank  of  America.  There  could  be  no  better  help  for  the  American  veteran  shivering  under  a  bridge  tonight  because  there  just  aren't  any  more  jobs.  (Unless  of  course,  you  can  beat  out  the  200  other  people  applying  for  that  one  lonely  job  opening.)  The  idea  is  that  bail-out  money  will  sooner  or  later  trickle-down  to  the  great  unwashed  masses  of  Americans  wondering  what  in  Sam  Hill  happened  to  the  real  estate  market  and  their  retirement  accounts.      It  may  only  be  a  drop  of  financial  bail-out  --  but  hey  it  trickled  down.  Next  up,  bread  lines!    The  truth  is  that  the  White  House  allowed  corporate  giant  CEOs  to  loot  and  pilfer  the  public  treasury.  This  Administration  is  following  the  same  tortured  logic  of  the  previous  one  which  assured  us  that  falsely  accused  cab  drivers  from  Baghdad  were  receiving  comfortable  attention  at  Guantanamo  Bay.    The  left-right  political  paradigm  in  this  country  is  a  sham.  (Sorry  to  disappoint  my  fellow  Evangelical  Christians.)  Both  parties  have  proven  to  be  Big  Business,  Big  Government  warmongers.  For  those  who  actually  wished  McCain  had  been  elected  just  think  about  this:  the  GOP  would  have  put  up  no  opposition  to  the  new  President's  Stimulus  Package  and  would  have  rammed  through  trillions  more  in  "help"  for  America.    So  there  you  have  it.  President  Obama  is  as  bad  as  the  worst  conservative  and  as  bad  as  the  worst  liberal  --  and  all  with  a  smile.    How  is  the  left-right  scenario  a  sham?  Consider  the  following.    The  gay  rights  issue  is  a  political  distraction.  Stem  cell  research?  Just  more  Big  Research  pork-barrel  spending.  Abortion?  It's  the  political  Gordian  Knot  that  requires  even  the  most  astute  of  political  science  majors  to  bust  a  gut  if  they  dare  try  to  untie  it.  The  so-called  immigration  invasion?  A  typical  act  of  sensational  yellow  journalism  that  says,  "Look  over  there,  Bubba!  It  ain't  your  own  government  stealin'  your  hard-earned  dollars,  it's  them  Mexicans  lookin'  for  revenge  and  dishwasher  jobs  since  the  Alamo!"  Sorry,  Pat  Buchanan,  the  "Death  of  the  West"  comes  from  the  corruption  in  our  government,  not  the  immigrants  heading  back  home  in  record  numbers.    What  are  the  real  issues  of  post-election  America?  For  starters,  the  destruction  of  individual  wealth  in  this  country,  save  for  the  high  upper  class.  We  are  on  the  verge  of  an  economic  meltdown  that  will  dwarf  the  Great  Depression  and  will  take  decades  to  recover.  There  is  no  need  for  a  conspiracy  theory  here  --  only  the  urgency  of  understanding  the  mess  that  we  allowed  to  happen  and  how  we  can  financially  protect  ourselves.    We  must  not  waste  time.  We  must  move  our  already-compromised  and  over-valued  U.S.  Dollars  into  assets  of  real  value.  This  does  not  include  real  estate  unless  you're  buying  ten  cents  or  less  on  the  high-priced  dollar.  Forget  your  401(k),  pensions  and  your  annuities.  Unless  you  can  take  your  money  out,  they  are  toast.  The  stock  market  is  one  toxic  graveyard,  particularly  finance  shares.  Dump  them.  Invest  in  precious  metals,  food  supply,  cigarettes,  alcohol  and  medicine  for  trade  and  help  for  your  neighbors  when  the  Dollar  collapses.    Consider  buying  silver,  palladium  and  gold  from  reputable  sellers  like  apmex.com.  I  personally  recommend  silverbullion.com  because  I  support  the  goals  of  the  owner  Jason  Hommel  to  bring  silver  back  as  the  most  effective  medium  of  exchange.  Remember,  that  despite  the  U.S.  Treasury's  naked  assertions,  the  U.S.  Constitution  expressly  reserves  the  right  of  individual  States  to  mint  legal  tender  coins  so  long  as  they're  gold  or  silver.    When  the  dollar  collapses,  I  do  not  think  that  New  York  City  will  burn  or  that  the  United  States  will  come  to  an  immediate  end.  But  if  it  did,  the  blame  must  rest  entirely  on  Barack  Obama  and  his  Congressional  Criminal  Syndicate.    Some  might  here  criticize  me  as  being  unfair.  After  all,  George  W.

I  think  Obama  has  been  a  great  President.  I  think  the  most  important  thing  he  has  done  is  make  the  US  a  bit  more  human  on  the  international  scale.	0
He  would  have  been  able  to  fulfill  his  promises  if  he  wasn't  such  a  good  guy  who  wanted  to  have  bipartisan  relations  with  the  entirety  of  Congress  despite  the  fact  that  the  Republicans  want  to  chop  down  his  policies  the  second  he  attempts  to  mention  trying  them.	0
